    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Data Link Layer”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. The data link layer takes the packets from _________ and encapsulates them into frames for transmission.
    <br/>
    a) network layer
    <br/>
    b) physical layer
    <br/>
    c) transport layer
    <br/>
    d) application layer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In computer networks, the data from application layer is sent to transport layer and is converted to segments. These segments are then transferred to the network layer and these are called packets. These packets are then sent to data link layer where they are encapsulated into frames. These frames are then transferred to physical layer where the frames are converted to bits. Error control and flow control data is inserted in the frames at the data link layer.

    6. When 2 or more bits in a data unit has been changed during the transmission, the error is called ____________
    <br/>
    a) random error
    <br/>
    b) burst error
    <br/>
    c) inverted error
    <br/>
    d) double error
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: When a single bit error occurs in a data, it is called single bit error. When more than a single bit of data is corrupted or has error, it is called burst error. If a single bit error occurs, the bit can be simply repaired by inverting it, but in case of a burst error, the sender has to send the frame again.

    d) bytes
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: In computer networks, the data from the application layer is sent to the transport layer and is converted to segments. These segments are then transferred to the network layer and these are called packets. These packets are then sent to data link layer where they are encapsulated into frames. These frames are then transferred to physical layer where the frames are converted to bits.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Topology”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Physical or logical arrangement of network is __________
    <br/>
    a) Topology
    <br/>
    b) Routing
    <br/>
    c) Networking
    <br/>
    d) Control
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Topology in networks is the structure or pattern in which each and every node in the network is connected. There are many topologies in networking like bus, tree, ring, star, mesh, and hybrid topology. There is no particular best topology and a suitable topology can be chosen based on the kind of application of the network .
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Which network topology requires a central controller or hub?
    <br/>
    a) Star
    <br/>
    b) Mesh
    <br/>
    c) Ring
    <br/>
    d) Bus
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In star topology, no computer is connected to another computer directly but all the computers are connected to a central hub. Every message sent from a source computer goes through the hub and the hub then forwards the message only to the intended destination computer.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    3. _______ topology requires a multipoint connection.
    <br/>
    a) Star
    <br/>
    b) Mesh
    <br/>
    c) Ring
    <br/>
    d) Bus
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: In bus topology, there is a single cable to which all the network nodes are connected. So whenever a node tries to send a message or data to other nodes, this data passes through all other nodes in the network through the cable. It is really simple to install but it’s not secure enough to be used in most of the computer network applications.

   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: TDM is the abbreviation for Time division multiplexing. It is technique for combining several low rate channels to a single high rate channel. For a certain time slot, the several channels could use the maximum bandwidth. Each channel is inactive for a period of time too. Some other multiplexing techniques are Frequency division multiplexing and Phase division multiplexing.

    8. _____ is the multiplexing technique that shifts each signal to a different carrier frequency.
    <br/>
    a) FDM
    <br/>
    b) TDM
    <br/>
    c) Both FDM &amp; TDM
    <br/>
    d) PDM
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: FDM is an abbreviation for Frequency Division Multiplexing. This technique is used when the bandwidth of the channel is greater than the combined bandwidth of all the signals which are to be transmitted. The channel is active at all times unless a collision occurs with another channel trying to use the same frequency. Some other multiplexing techniques are Time division multiplexing and Phase division multiplexing.

    4. If there are n signal sources of same data rate, then the TDM link has _______ slots.
    <br/>
    a) n
    <br/>
    b) n/2
    <br/>
    c) n*2
    <br/>
    d) 2
    <sup>
     n
    </sup>
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In TDM, the total unit of time is divided equally among all the signal sources and each and every source has access to the complete channel bandwidth during its allotted time slot. When the time slot of the source is not active, it remains idle and waits for its slot to begin.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    5. If link transmits 4000frames per second, and each slot has 8 bits, the transmission rate of circuit this TDM is _________
    <br/>
    a) 32kbps
    <br/>
    b) 500bps
    <br/>
    c) 500kbps
    <br/>
    d) 32bps
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Transmission rate= frame rate * number of bits in a slot.
    <br/>
    Given: Frame rate = 4000/sec and number of bits in slot = 8
    <br/>
    Thus, Transmission rate = (4000 * 8) bps
    <br/>
    = 32000bps
    <br/>
    = 32kbps

    6. The state when dedicated signals are idle are called __________
    <br/>
    a) Death period
    <br/>
    b) Poison period
    <br/>
    c) Silent period
    <br/>
    d) Stop period
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: There are instances when connection between two endpoints has been established, but no communication or transfer of messages occurs. This period of time is called silent period. The silent period ends when either of the two endpoints starts the communication.
    <br/>

    7. Multiplexing provides _________
    <br/>
    a) Efficiency
    <br/>
    b) Privacy
    <br/>
    c) Anti jamming
    <br/>
    d) Both Efficiency &amp; Privacy
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Multiplexing helps us to transfer our messages over a shared channel. This brings up the issue of privacy and efficiency. Fortunately, Multiplexing has high efficiency and high privacy when implemented because in the implementation, the transport layer of the OSI network model handles the function of multiplexing through interfaces called ports which provide the required efficiency and privacy.

    8. In TDM, the transmission rate of a multiplexed path is always _______ the sum of the transmission rates of the signal sources.
    <br/>
    a) Greater than
    <br/>
    b) Lesser than
    <br/>
    c) Equal to
    <br/>
    d) Equal to or greater than
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In TDM the transmission rate provided by the path that is multiplexed will always be greater than the sum of transmission rates of the single sources. This happens because the transmission rate is provided to each source only for a small period of time.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    9. In TDM, slots are further divided into _________
    <br/>
    a) Seconds
    <br/>
    b) Frames

    1. Which of the following delay is faced by the packet in travelling from one end system to another?
    <br/>
    a) Propagation delay
    <br/>
    b) Queuing delay
    <br/>
    c) Transmission delay
    <br/>
    d) All of the mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: When a packet has to travel from one end system to another, it first faces the queuing delay when there are multiple packets which are to be sent, then it faces the transmission delay to convert the packet into bits to be transmitted, and then it faces the propagation delay to propagate the bits through the physical medium.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    2. For a 10Mbps Ethernet link, if the length of the packet is 32bits, the transmission delay is ____________ (in microseconds)
    <br/>
    a) 3.2
    <br/>
    b) 32
    <br/>
    c) 0.32
    <br/>
    d) 320
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Transmission rate = length / transmission rate = 32/10 = 3.2 microseconds.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    3. The time required to examine the packet’s header and determine where to direct the packet is part of __________
    <br/>
    a) Processing delay
    <br/>
    b) Queuing delay
    <br/>
    c) Transmission delay
    <br/>
    d) Propagation delay
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Processing delay is induced at a router’s or other network processor’s end in the path of the packet and is caused by the time taken by the processor to examine the packet’s header to decide the further path of the packet.

    6. If end to end delay is given by dend-end = N(dproc + dtrans + dprop) is a non congested network. The number of routers between source and destination is?
    <br/>
    a) N/2
    <br/>
    b) N
    <br/>
    c) N-1
    <br/>
    d) 2N
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: In the equation N (dproc + dtrans + dprop), N is the number of checkpoints/stops that the packet makes as it reaches the destination. The stops are made at each router and the final destination node. Now, since N = number of routers + final node, then number of routers = N – final node. As we know, there is only 1 final node in a path, thus, number of routers = N – 1. Suppose, There is a path A-&gt;R1-&gt;R2-&gt;B for a packet where A is the source node, B is the final node and R1 and R2 are routers. The total delay would be given by N (dproc + dtrans + dprop) where N = 3, since the packet would stop at R1, R2 and B. The number of routers here are 2, and (N – 1) is also 2.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    7. The total nodal delay is given by ____________
    <br/>
    a) dnodal = dproc – dqueue + dtrans + dprop
    <br/>
    b) dnodal = dproc + dtrans – dqueue
    <br/>
    c) dnodal = dproc + dqueue + dtrans + dprop
    <br/>
    d) dnodal = dproc + dqueue – dtrans – dprop
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The total node-to-node delay, that is, nodal delay is the sum of all, the processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay and propagation delay. Ideally, the nodal delay must be low as possible for a better Quality of Service of the network.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    8. In a network, If P is the only packet being transmitted and there was no earlier transmission, which of the following delays could be zero?
    <br/>
    a) Propagation delay
    <br/>
    b) Queuing delay
    <br/>
    c) Transmission delay
    <br/>
    d) Processing delay
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Since there is no other packet to be transmitted, there is no need for a queue. Therefore, the delay caused due to the queuing would be none i.e. 0.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    9. Transmission delay does not depend on _____________
    <br/>
    a) Packet length
    <br/>
    b) Distance between the routers
    <br/>
    c) Transmission rate
    <br/>
    d) Bandwidth of medium
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Transmission delay = packet length / transmission rate. The transmission rate depends upon the bandwidth of the medium.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    10. Propagation delay depends on ___________
    <br/>
    a) Packet length
    <br/>
    b) Transmission rate
    <br/>
    c) Distance between the routers
    <br/>
    d) Speed of the CPU
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Propagation delay is caused when the packet is in its electric signal form and is travelling through a medium (a wire or a electromagnetic wave). Propagation delay is the time it takes a bit to propagate from one router to the next. If the distance between the routers is increased, it will take longer time to propagate, that is, there would be more propagation delay.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Network  Attacks”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. The attacker using a network of compromised devices is known as _____________
    <br/>
    a) Internet
    <br/>
    b) Botnet
    <br/>
    c) Telnet
    <br/>
    d) D-net
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Botnet is a network of compromised devices used by the attacker without the owner’s knowledge to perform unethical activities such as spamming. The attacker usually uses the least secure devices to create the botnet.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Which of the following is a form of DoS attack?
    <br/>
    a) Vulnerability attack
    <br/>
    b) Bandwidth flooding
    <br/>
    c) Connection flooding
    <br/>
    d) All of the mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: In a DoS attack, the attacker won’t let the victims access the network by using a certain method that ensures that an essential network resource is unavailable to the victim. In vulnerability attack, the attacker exploits any obvious vulnerable entity in the network to deny the victim access into the network. In bandwidth flooding, the attacker floods the victim with a huge flow of packets and uses up all the bandwidth. In connection flooding, the attacker floods the victim network with a huge number of connections, so that, no other machine can connect to it.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    3. The DoS attack, in which the attacker establishes a large number of half-open or fully open TCP connections at the target host is ________
    <br/>
    a) Vulnerability attack
    <br/>
    b) Bandwidth flooding
    <br/>
    c) Connection flooding
    <br/>
    d) UDP flooding
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: In Vulnerability attack, the attacker exploits the vulnerable control points of the network to deny access to the victims. In Bandwidth flooding, the attacker intentionally uses up all the bandwidth by flooding the victim with a deluge of packets and makes sure that the victim can’t use any bandwidth. In UDP flooding, too many UDP packets are sent by the attacker to the victim at random ports.

    4. The DoS attack, in which the attacker sends deluge of packets to the targeted host is ________
    <br/>
    a) Vulnerability attack
    <br/>
    b) Bandwidth flooding
    <br/>
    c) Connection flooding
    <br/>
    d) UDP flooding
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: In Bandwidth flooding, the attacker floods the victim machine with a deluge of packets to make sure that no bandwidth is available. The victim then cannot utilize the complete bandwidth to perform its operation.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    5. Packet sniffers involve ____________
    <br/>
    a) Active receiver
    <br/>
    b) Passive receiver
    <br/>
    c) Legal receiver
    <br/>
    d) Partially-active receiver
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The function of packet sniffers is to just silently receive the packets flowing in the channel. If they inject any packets into the channel, they might alert the other users about the intrusion.

    6. Sniffers can be prevented by using _______________
    <br/>
    a) Wired environment
    <br/>
    b) WiFi
    <br/>
    c) Ethernet LAN
    <br/>
    d) Switched network
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Switches make sure that the packet is sent to the intended receiver and no one else, thus preventing Sniffers to perform their function. Intelligent switches are hence used preferably for the network.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    7. Firewalls are often configured to block ___________
    <br/>
    a) UDP traffic
    <br/>
    b) TCP traffic
    <br/>
    c) Sensitive traffic
    <br/>
    d) Best-effort traffic
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: UDP is more vulnerable to attacks, so firewalls are often configured to block suspicious UDP traffic.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    8. In a network, If P is the only packet being transmitted and there was no earlier transmission, which of the following delays could be zero?
    <br/>
    a) Propagation delay
    <br/>
    b) Queuing delay
    <br/>
    c) Transmission delay
    <br/>
    d) Processing delay
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Since there is no other packet to be transmitted, there is no need for a queue. Therefore, the delay caused due to the queuing would be none i.e. 0.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Packet Switching &amp; Circuit Switching”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. A local telephone network is an example of a _______ network.
    <br/>
    a) Packet switched
    <br/>
    b) Circuit switched
    <br/>
    c) Bit switched
    <br/>
    d) Line switched
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Circuit switching is connection oriented switching technique, whereas in the case of packet switching, it is connectionless. Circuit switching is implemented in the Physical layer, whereas packet switching is implemented in the Network layer. Internet too is based on the concept of circuit switching.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Most packet switches use this principle ____________
    <br/>
    a) Stop and wait
    <br/>
    b) Store and forward
    <br/>
    c) Store and wait
    <br/>
    d) Stop and forward
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The packet switch will not transmit the first bit to outbound link until it receives the entire packet. If the entire packet is not received and the time-out period expires, the packet switch will inform the sender to resend the part of packet or the entire packet based on the algorithm being used.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    3. If there are N routers from source to destination, the total end to end delay in sending packet P(L-&gt; number of bits in the packet R-&gt; transmission rate) is equal to ______________
    <br/>
    a) N
    <br/>
    b) (N*L)/R
    <br/>
    c) (2N*L)/R
    <br/>
    d) L/R
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The equation to find the end to end delay when no. of bits, transmission rate and no. of routers is given by (N*L)/R. The total end to end delay, that is, nodal delay is the sum of all, the processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay and propagation delay.

    4. What are the Methods to move data through a network of links and switches?
    <br/>
    a) Packet switching and Line switching
    <br/>
    b) Circuit switching and Line switching
    <br/>
    c) Line switching and bit switching
    <br/>
    d) Packet switching and Circuit switching
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Packet switching and Circuit switching are two different types of switching methods used to connect the multiple communicating devices with one another. Packet switching is used in conventional LAN systems and circuit switching is used in telephonic systems.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    5. The required resources for communication between end systems are reserved for the duration of the session between end systems in ________ method.
    <br/>
    a) Packet switching
    <br/>
    b) Circuit switching
    <br/>
    c) Line switching
    <br/>
    d) Frequency switching
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: In circuit switching, a physical path between the sender and receiver is established. This path is maintained until the connection is needed. Circuit switching is implemented in the Physical layer and is used in telephonic systems.
    <br/>

   <p>
    6. As the resources are reserved between two communicating end systems in circuit switching, ___________ is achieved.
    <br/>
    a) authentication
    <br/>
    b) guaranteed constant rate
    <br/>
    c) reliability
    <br/>
    d) store and forward
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Circuit switching is connection oriented and is always implemented in the physical layer. Once a path is set, all transmission occurs through the same path. It is used since the early times in telephonic systems.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    7. In _________ systems, resources are allocated on demand.
    <br/>
    a) packet switching
    <br/>
    b) circuit switching
    <br/>
    c) line switching
    <br/>
    d) frequency switching
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In packet switching, the bits are received in out of order and need to be assembled at the receiver end, whereas in the case of Circuit switching, all the bits are received in order. All transmissions may not occur through the same path in case of packet switching.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Which of the following is not an application layer service?
    <br/>
    a) Network virtual terminal
    <br/>
    b) File transfer, access, and management
    <br/>
    c) Mail service
    <br/>
    d) Error control
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Application layer is the topmost layer in the OSI model. Network virtual terminal, mail service, file transfer, access and management are all services of the application layer. It uses protocols like HTTP, FTP, and DNS etc. to provide these services.

    d) Fast Transfer Protocol
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: File Transfer Protocol is an application layer protocol used to share “files” between a server and a client. The protocol uses two separate ports for data and control connections: port 20 for data and port 21 for control.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    2. FTP is built on _____ architecture.
    <br/>

    d) Service oriented
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: An FTP connection includes a Server and a Client which wish to share a number of data files. The server can transfer files with multiple clients at the same time while the client communicates with only one server at a time.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>

    4. Identify the incorrect statement regarding FTP.
    <br/>
    a) FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol
    <br/>
    b) FTP uses two parallel TCP connections
    <br/>
    c) FTP sends its control information in-band
    <br/>
    d) FTP sends exactly one file over the data connection
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: FTP is out-of-band because the data connection is done separately through port 20 and control connection is done separately through port 21.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    5. If 5 files are transferred from server A to client B in the same session. The number of TCP connections between A and B is _______
    <br/>
    a) 5
    <br/>
    b) 10
    <br/>
    c) 2
    <br/>
    d) 6
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The client would first initiate the TCP control connection through port 21. Then for every file transfer, a separate connection would be made through port 20. Now, since we have five files to be transferred, 1 control connection + 5 data connections = 6 total TCP connections.

    <br/>
    a) Maintains state information
    <br/>
    b) Is stateless
    <br/>
    c) Has single TCP connection for a file transfer
    <br/>
    d) Has UDP connection for file transfer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: FTP server maintains state information of every control connection to keep track of the active and inactive connections in the session. This helps the server decide which connection to terminate, in case the connection is inactive for too long.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    7. The commands, from client to server, and replies, from server to client, are sent across the control connection in ________ bit ASCII format.
    <br/>
    a) 8
    <br/>
    b) 7
    <br/>
    c) 3
    <br/>
    d) 5
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: FTP was designed to transmit commands only in English characters that are possible with just 7 bits in ASCII. Even the media has to be converted to ASCII before transmission.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Find the FTP reply whose message is wrongly matched.
    <br/>
    a) 331 – Username OK, password required
    <br/>
    b) 425 – Can’t open data connection
    <br/>
    c) 452 – Error writing file
    <br/>
    d) 452 – Can’t open data connection
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The correct response code for the message “Can’t open data connection” is 425. Response code 452 is sent usually when the connection is suddenly closed.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    9. The data transfer mode of FTP, in which all the fragmenting has to be done by TCP is ________
    <br/>
    a) Stream mode
    <br/>
    b) Block mode
    <br/>
    c) Compressed mode
    <br/>
    d) Message mode
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Stream mode is the default mode of FTP, in which the TCP transforms/fragments the data into segments, and then after the transmission is completed, converts it back to stream of bytes.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    10. The password is sent to the server using ________ command.
    <br/>
    a) PASSWD
    <br/>
    b) PASS
    <br/>
    c) PASSWORD
    <br/>
    d) PWORD
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The PASS command, preceded by the username, completes the user’s identification for access control in an FTP session. Without the valid password, the user won’t be able to initiate the FTP connection.

    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a

    <br/>
    a) default mode
    <br/>
    b) server mode
    <br/>
    c) line mode
    <br/>
    d) character mode
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: In line mode, terminal character processing is done on the client side but editing is enabled on the server side. Line mode reduces the number of packets and is useful for long delay networks.

    8. If we want that a character be interpreted by the client instead of server _________
    <br/>
    a) interpret as command (IAC) escape character has to be used
    <br/>
    b) control functions has to be disabled
    <br/>
    c) it is not possible
    <br/>
    d) cli character has to be used
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The client must look at each byte that arrives and look for IAC escape character. If IAC is found, the client moves on to look for any other code or IAC. If the next byte is IAC – a single byte is presented by the client to the terminal. If IAC is followed by any other code than IAC, the client interprets this as a command.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Telnet – 2”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Telnet protocol is used to establish a connection to __________
    <br/>
    a) TCP port number 21
    <br/>
    b) TCP port number 22
    <br/>
    c) TCP port number 23
    <br/>
    d) TCP port number 25
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: TCP port 21 is used for FTP, TCP port 22 is used for SSH and TCP port 25 is used for SMTP. Telnet provides access to a command line interface on a remote computer using the TCP port number 23.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Which one of the following is not true?
    <br/>
    a) telnet defines a network virtual terminal (NVT) standard
    <br/>
    b) client programs interact with NVT
    <br/>
    c) server translates NVT operations
    <br/>
    d) client can transfer files using to remote server using NVT
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The client can use the NVT only to interact with the programs already present on the remote server, not to transfer files to it. To transfer files, an FTP connection has to be used.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    3. All telnet operations are sent as ________
    <br/>
    a) 4 bits
    <br/>
    b) 8 bits
    <br/>
    c) 16 bits
    <br/>
    d) 32 bits
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Telnet provides a bi-directional, 8-bit byte oriented communications facility through which operations are sent as 8-bit bytes for the server to interpret.

    6. Which of the following is true for character mode operation of telnet implementation?
    <br/>
    a) each character typed is sent by the client to the server
    <br/>
    b) each character typed is discarded by the server
    <br/>
    c) each character typed is aggregated into a word and then sent to the server
    <br/>
    d) each character type is aggregated into a line and then sent to the server
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In character mode, each character that the user is typing is immediately sent to the server which then interprets it only after the complete operation command is received.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    7. In which mode of telnet, the client echoes the character on the screen but does not send it until a whole line is completed?
    <br/>
    a) default mode
    <br/>
    b) character mode
    <br/>
    c) server mode
    <br/>
    d) command mode
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In the default mode, the client does not send each character typed by the user to the server, thus saving the amount of packet transmissions required for executing each operation. But the server has to remain idle until the client sends the completed line wasting a lot of time.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Which one of the following is not correct?
    <br/>
    a) telnet is a general purpose client-server program

    <br/>
    c) telnet can also be used for file transfer
    <br/>
    d) telnet can be used for remote login
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: File Transfer Protocol is used for file transfer. Telnet provides access to the command-line interface on a remote host.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “TCP-1”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Which of the following is false with respect to TCP?
    <br/>
    a) Connection-oriented
    <br/>
    b) Process-to-process
    <br/>
    c) Transport layer protocol
    <br/>
    d) Unreliable
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: TCP is a transport layer protocol that provides reliable and ordered delivery of a stream of bytes between hosts communicating via an IP network.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. In TCP, sending and receiving data is done as _______
    <br/>
    a) Stream of bytes
    <br/>
    b) Sequence of characters
    <br/>
    c) Lines of data
    <br/>
    d) Packets
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: TCP provides stream oriented delivery between hosts communicating via an IP network and there are no message boundaries. TCP can concatenate data from a number of send () commands into one stream of data and still transmit it reliably.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. TCP process may not write and read data at the same speed. So we need __________ for storage.
    <br/>
    a) Packets
    <br/>
    b) Buffers
    <br/>
    c) Segments
    <br/>
    d) Stacks
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: A TCP receiver has a receive buffer that is used to store the unprocessed incoming packets in case the sender is sending packets faster than the processing rate of the received packets.

    4. TCP groups a number of bytes together into a packet called _______
    <br/>
    a) Packet
    <br/>
    b) Buffer
    <br/>
    c) Segment
    <br/>
    d) Stack
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: A segment may be collection of data from many send () statements. TCP transmits each segment as a stream of bytes.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. Communication offered by TCP is ________
    <br/>
    a) Full-duplex
    <br/>
    b) Half-duplex
    <br/>
    c) Semi-duplex
    <br/>
    d) Byte by byte
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Data can flow both the directions at the same time during a TCP communication hence, it is full-duplex. This is the reason why TCP is used in systems that require full-duplex operation such as e-mail systems.

    6. To achieve reliable transport in TCP, ___________ is used to check the safe and sound arrival of data.
    <br/>
    a) Packet
    <br/>
    b) Buffer
    <br/>
    c) Segment
    <br/>
    d) Acknowledgment
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Acknowledgment mechanism is used to check the safe and sound arrival of data. The sender actively checks for acknowledgement from the receiver and once a specific time period has passed, it retransmits the data.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. In segment header, sequence number and acknowledgement number fields refer to _______
    <br/>
    a) Byte number
    <br/>
    b) Buffer number
    <br/>
    c) Segment number
    <br/>
    d) Acknowledgment
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: As TCP has to ensure ordered delivery of packets, sequence number and acknowledgement number are used to identify the byte number of the packet in the stream of bytes being transmitted.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Suppose a TCP connection is transferring a file of 1000 bytes. The first byte is numbered 10001. What is the sequence number of the segment if all data is sent in only one segment?
    <br/>
    a) 10000
    <br/>
    b) 10001
    <br/>
    c) 12001
    <br/>
    d) 11001
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The sequence number given to first byte of a segment, with respect to its order among the previous segments, is the sequence number of that segment.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. Bytes of data being transferred in each connection are numbered by TCP. These numbers start with a _________
    <br/>
    a) Fixed number
    <br/>
    b) Random sequence of 0’s and 1’s
    <br/>
    c) One
    <br/>
    d) Sequence of zero’s and one’s
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: One might expect the sequence number of the first byte in the stream to be 0, or 1. But that does not happen in TCP, Instead, the sender has to choose an Initial Sequence Number (ISN), which is basically a random 32 bit sequence of 0’s and 1’s, during the connection handshake.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. The value of acknowledgement field in a segment defines _______
    <br/>
    a) sequence number of the byte received previously
    <br/>
    b) total number of bytes to receive
    <br/>
    c) sequence number of the next byte to be received
    <br/>
    d) sequence of zeros and ones
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The acknowledgement field in a segment defines the sequence number of the byte which is to be received next i.e. sequence number of byte that the sender should transmit next.

    This set of Computer Networks Interview Questions and Answers for freshers focuses on “TCP – 2”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. The receiver of the data controls the amount of data that are to be sent by the sender is referred to as ___________
    <br/>
    a) Flow control
    <br/>
    b) Error control
    <br/>
    c) Congestion control
    <br/>
    d) Error detection
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Flow control is done to prevent the receiver from being overflowed with data. It is done using various open-loop (prevention) methods and closed-loop (recovery) methods.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Size of TCP segment header ranges between ___________
    <br/>
    a) 16 and 32 bytes
    <br/>
    b) 16 and 32 bits
    <br/>
    c) 20 and 60 bytes
    <br/>
    d) 20 and 60 bits
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The size of the header can be 20 bytes at a minimum if there are no options and can go up to 60 bytes at maximum with 40 bytes in the options field. The header contains all the control information required to ensure ordered, error-free and reliable delivery of the segment.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Connection establishment in TCP is done by which mechanism?
    <br/>
    a) Flow control
    <br/>
    b) Three-Way Handshaking
    <br/>
    c) Forwarding
    <br/>
    d) Synchronization
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: A three-way handshake allows both, the server and the client to choose their Initial Sequence Number and inform about it to the other party. This won’t be possible using the two-way handshake mechanism.

    4. The server program tells its TCP that it is ready to accept a connection. This process is called ___________
    <br/>
    a) Active open
    <br/>
    b) Active close
    <br/>
    c) Passive close
    <br/>
    d) Passive open
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: This is the first step in the Three-Way Handshaking process and is started by the server. Then the Client picks an ISN (Initial Sequence Number) and synchronizes (shares) it with the Server requesting a connection. The Server acknowledges the clients ISN, and then picks an ISN and synchronizes it with the Client. At last, the Client acknowledges the servers ISN.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. A client that wishes to connect to an open server tells its TCP that it needs to be connected to that particular server. The process is called ___________
    <br/>
    a) Active open
    <br/>
    b) Active close
    <br/>
    c) Passive close
    <br/>
    d) Passive open
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: This is the second step in the Three-Way Handshaking process and is done by the client once it finds the open server and picks an ISN. The Server acknowledges the clients request, and then picks an ISN and synchronizes it with the Client. At last, the Client acknowledges the servers ISN.

    6. In Three-Way Handshaking process, the situation where both the TCP’s issue an active open is ___________
    <br/>
    a) Mutual open
    <br/>
    b) Mutual Close
    <br/>
    c) Simultaneous open
    <br/>
    d) Simultaneous close
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: In simultaneous open situation, two nodes send an SYN signal to each other and start a TCP connection. Here, both TCP nodes transmit a SYNC+ACK segment to each other and a connection is established between them. This doesn’t happen usually, because both sides have to know which port on the other side to send to.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. A malicious attacker sends a large number of SYNC segments to a server, pretending that each of them is coming from a different client by faking the source IP address in the datagram. Which type of attack is being performed in this situation?
    <br/>
    a) SYNC flooding attack
    <br/>
    b) Active attack
    <br/>
    c) Passive attack
    <br/>
    d) Denial-of-service attack
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: SYNC flooding attack is a form of Denial of Service attack. Due to the overflow of SYNC segments sent to the server, the victims are not able to request for a connection to the server, thus resulting in Denial of Service.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. SYNC flooding attack belongs to a type of security attack known as ___________
    <br/>
    a) SYNC flooding attack
    <br/>
    b) Active attack
    <br/>
    c) Passive attack
    <br/>
    d) Denial-of-service attack
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: During SYNC flooding the system collapses and denies service to every request, making it a DoS attack. Some other DoS attacks are bandwidth flooding, connection flooding and UDP flooding.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. The sizes of source and destination port address in TCP header are ___________ respectively.
    <br/>
    a) 16-bits and 32-bits
    <br/>
    b) 16-bits and 16-bits
    <br/>
    c) 32-bits and 16-bits
    <br/>
    d) 32-bits and 32-bits
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: All port addresses are of 16 bits and they specify the type of service being used by the network entity. For example, port 21 is used for FTP connections and port 25 is used for ICMP connections.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. What allows TCP to detect lost segments and in turn recover from that loss?
    <br/>
    a) Sequence number
    <br/>
    b) Acknowledgment number
    <br/>
    c) Checksum
    <br/>
    d) Both Sequence &amp; Acknowledgment number
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: TCP header contains separate fields for sequence number and acknowledgment number. Comparing these values is what allows TCP to detect lost segments and in turn recover from that loss. After detecting the lost segments, the recovery may require retransmission of the lost segments of data.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “UDP”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Which of the following is false with respect to UDP?
    <br/>
    a) Connection-oriented
    <br/>
    b) Unreliable
    <br/>
    c) Transport layer protocol
    <br/>
    d) Low overhead
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: UDP is an unreliable, connectionless transport layer protocol that provides message-based data transmission. TCP is an example of connection-oriented protocols.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Return value of the UDP port “Chargen” is _______
    <br/>
    a) String of characters
    <br/>
    b) String of integers
    <br/>
    c) Array of characters with integers
    <br/>
    d) Array of zero’s and one’s
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Using Chargen with UDP on port 19, the server sends a UDP datagram containing a random number of characters every time it receives a datagram from the connecting host. The number of characters is between 0 and 512.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Beyond IP, UDP provides additional services such as _______
    <br/>
    a) Routing and switching
    <br/>
    b) Sending and receiving of packets
    <br/>
    c) Multiplexing and demultiplexing
    <br/>
    d) Demultiplexing and error checking
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: De-multiplexing is the delivering of received segments to the correct application layer processes at the recipients end using UDP. Error checking is done through checksum in UDP.

    4. What is the main advantage of UDP?
    <br/>
    a) More overload
    <br/>
    b) Reliable
    <br/>
    c) Low overhead
    <br/>
    d) Fast
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: As UDP does not provide assurance of delivery of packet, reliability and other services, the overhead taken to provide these services is reduced in UDP’s operation. Thus, UDP provides low overhead, and higher speed.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. Port number used by Network Time Protocol (NTP) with UDP is ________
    <br/>
    a) 161
    <br/>
    b) 123
    <br/>
    c) 162
    <br/>
    d) 124
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The Network Time Protocol is a clock synchronization network protocol implemented by using UDP port number 123 to send and receive time stamps.

    6. What is the header size of a UDP packet?
    <br/>
    a) 8 bytes
    <br/>
    b) 8 bits
    <br/>
    c) 16 bytes
    <br/>
    d) 124 bytes
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The fixed size of the UDP packet header is 8 bytes. It contains four two-byte fields: Source port address, Destination port address, Length of packet, and checksum.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. The port number is “ephemeral port number”, if the source host is _______
    <br/>
    a) NTP
    <br/>
    b) Echo
    <br/>
    c) Server
    <br/>
    d) Client
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Port numbers from 1025 to 5000 are used as ephemeral port numbers in Windows Operating System. Ephemeral port numbers are short-lived port numbers which can be used for clients in a UDP system where there are temporary clients all the time.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. “Total length” field in UDP packet header is the length of _________
    <br/>
    a) Only UDP header
    <br/>
    b) Only data
    <br/>
    c) Only checksum
    <br/>
    d) UDP header plus data
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Total length is the 16 bit field which contains the length of UDP header and the data. The maximum value of the Total length field and the maximum size of a UDP datagram is 65,535 bytes (8 byte header + 65,527 bytes of data).
   </div>
   <p>
    9. Which is the correct expression for the length of UDP datagram?
    <br/>
    a) UDP length = IP length – IP header’s length
    <br/>
    b) UDP length = UDP length – UDP header’s length
    <br/>
    c) UDP length = IP length + IP header’s length
    <br/>
    d) UDP length = UDP length + UDP header’s length
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: A user datagram is encapsulated in an IP datagram. There is a field in the IP header that defines the total length of the IP packet. There is another field in the IP header that defines the length of the header. So if we subtract the length of the IP header that is encapsulated in the IP packet, we get the length of UDP datagram.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. The ______ field is used to detect errors over the entire user datagram.
    <br/>
    a) udp header
    <br/>
    b) checksum
    <br/>
    c) source port
    <br/>
    d) destination port
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Checksum field is used to detect errors over the entire user datagram. Though it is not as efficient as CRC which is used in TCP, it gets the job done for the UDP datagram as UDP doesn’t have to ensure the delivery of the packet.

    This set of Computer Networks Questions and Answers for Experienced people focuses on “AH and ESP Protocols”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Which mode of IPsec should you use to assure the security and confidentiality of data within the same LAN?
    <br/>
    a) AH transport mode
    <br/>
    b) ESP transport mode
    <br/>
    c) ESP tunnel mode
    <br/>
    d) AH tunnel mode
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: ESP transport mode should be used to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data that is exchanged within the same LAN. ESP tunnel mode is comparatively more secure and should be used to assure the security of the data within different LANs.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Which two types of encryption protocols can be used to secure the authentication of computers using IPsec?
    <br/>
    a) Kerberos V5
    <br/>
    b) SHA
    <br/>
    c) MD5
    <br/>
    d) Both SHA and MD5
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: SHA or MD5 can be used. Kerberos V5 is an authentication protocol, not an encryption protocol; therefore, answer A is incorrect. Certificates are a type of authentication that can be used with IPsec, not an encryption protocol; therefore, answer B is incorrect.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Which two types of IPsec can be used to secure communications between two LANs?
    <br/>
    a) AH tunnel mode
    <br/>
    b) ESP tunnel mode
    <br/>
    c) Both AH tunnel mode and ESP tunnel mode
    <br/>
    d) ESP transport mode
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The AH and ESP tunnel mode IPSec should be used for data transfer purpose, option d is for integrity &amp; confidentiality purpose. Tunnel mode provides security for the entire original IP packet unlike transport mode which is not as secure as it only encrypts the data portion and not the whole packet.

   </div>
   <p>
    5. IPsec defines two protocols: _______ and ________
    <br/>
    a) AH; SSL
    <br/>
    b) PGP; ESP
    <br/>
    c) AH; ESP
    <br/>
    d) PGP; SSL
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: AH ensures that there is no retransmission of data from an unauthorized source, and protects against data tampering. ESP provides with content protection and ensures that there is integrity and confidentiality for the message.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Congestion Control”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Two broad categories of congestion control are
    <br/>
    a) Open-loop and Closed-loop
    <br/>
    b) Open-control and Closed-control
    <br/>
    c) Active  control and Passive control
    <br/>
    d) Active loop and Passive loop
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Open loop congestion control techniques are used to prevent congestion before it even happens by enforcing certain policies. Closed loop congestion control techniques are used to treat congestion after it has happened.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. In open-loop control, policies are applied to __________
    <br/>
    a) Remove after congestion occurs
    <br/>
    b) Remove after sometime
    <br/>
    c) Prevent before congestion occurs
    <br/>
    d) Prevent before sending packets
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Open loop congestion control techniques are used to prevent congestion before it even happens by enforcing certain policies. Retransmission policy, window policy and acknowledgement policy are some policies that might be enforced.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Retransmission of packets must not be done when _______
    <br/>
    a) Packet is lost
    <br/>
    b) Packet is corrupted
    <br/>
    c) Packet is needed
    <br/>
    d) Packet is error-free
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Retransmission refers to the sender having to resend the packet to the receiver. It needs to be done only when some anomaly occurs with the packet like when the packet is lost or corrupted.

    4. In Go-Back-N window, when the timer of the packet times out, several packets have to be resent even some may have arrived safe. Whereas in Selective Repeat window, the sender resends ___________
    <br/>
    a) Packet which are not lost
    <br/>
    b) Only those packets which are lost or corrupted
    <br/>
    c) Packet from starting
    <br/>
    d) All the packets
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: In Selective Repeat, the sender side uses a searching algorithm to find the packets which need to be retransmitted based on the negative acknowledgements received and then resends only those packets thus saving bandwidth.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. Discarding policy is mainly done by _______
    <br/>
    a) Sender
    <br/>
    b) Receiver
    <br/>
    c) Router
    <br/>
    d) Switch
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The discarding policy adopted by the routers mainly states that the routers discard sensitive or corrupted packets that it receives, thus controlling the integrity of the packet flow. The discarding policy is adopted as an open loop congestion control technique.

    6. Closed-Loop control mechanisms try to _________
    <br/>
    a) Remove after congestion occurs
    <br/>
    b) Remove after sometime
    <br/>
    c) Prevent before congestion occurs
    <br/>
    d) Prevent before sending packets
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In closed loop congestion control, methods are implemented to remove congestion after it occurs. Some of the methods used are backpressure and choke packet.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. The technique in which a congested node stops receiving data from the immediate upstream node or nodes is called as _______
    <br/>
    a) Admission policy
    <br/>
    b) Backpressure
    <br/>
    c) Forward signaling
    <br/>
    d) Backward signaling
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: In this closed loop congestion control technique, the congested node propagates in the opposite direction of the data flow to inform the predecessor node to reduce the flow of packets. This is why this technique is called a node-to-node congestion control technique.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Backpressure technique can be applied only to _______
    <br/>
    a) Congestion networks
    <br/>
    b) Closed circuit networks
    <br/>
    c) Open circuit networks
    <br/>
    d) Virtual circuit networks
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: In Virtual circuit networks, each node knows the upstream node from which a flow data is coming. So, it makes possible for the congested node to track the source of the congestion and then inform that node to reduce the flow to remove congestion.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. The packet sent by a node to the source to inform it of congestion is called _______
    <br/>
    a) Explicit
    <br/>
    b) Discard
    <br/>
    c) Choke
    <br/>
    d) Backpressure
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Choke packet is sent by a node to the source to inform it of congestion. Two choke packet techniques can be used for the operation called hop-by-hop choke packet and source choke packet.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. In the slow-start algorithm, the size of the congestion window increases __________ until it reaches a threshold.
    <br/>
    a) exponentially
    <br/>
    b) additively
    <br/>
    c) multiplicatively
    <br/>
    d) suddenly
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In slow-start algorithm, the size of the congestion window increases exponentially until it reaches a threshold. When it reaches the threshold, it stops increasing and continues sending packets through the threshold window thus preventing congestion.
   </div>
   <p>
    11.  In the congestion avoidance algorithm, the size of the congestion window increases ____________ until congestion is detected.
    <br/>
    a) exponentially
    <br/>
    b) additively
    <br/>
    c) multiplicatively
    <br/>
    d) suddenly
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: In the congestion avoidance algorithm, the size of the congestion window increases additively until congestion is detected. Once congestion is detected, the size of congestion window is decreased once and then the packets are transmitted to achieve congestion avoidance.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “IPv4”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Which of the following is not applicable for IP?
    <br/>
    a) Error reporting
    <br/>
    b) Handle addressing conventions
    <br/>
    c) Datagram format
    <br/>
    d) Packet handling conventions
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The Internet Protocol is the networking protocol which establishes the internet by relaying datagrams across network boundaries. ICMP is a supporting protocol for IP which handles the Error Reporting functionality.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Which of the following field in IPv4 datagram is not related to fragmentation?
    <br/>
    a) Flags
    <br/>
    b) Offset
    <br/>
    c) TOS
    <br/>
    d) Identifier
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: TOS-type of service identifies the type of packets. It is not related to fragmentation but is used to request specific treatment such as high throughput, high reliability or low latency for the IP packet depending upon the type of service it belongs to.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    3. The TTL field has value 10. How many routers (max) can process this datagram?
    <br/>
    a) 11
    <br/>
    b) 5
    <br/>
    c) 10
    <br/>
    d) 1
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: TTL stands for Time to Live. This field specifies the life of the IP packet based on the number of hops it makes (Number of routers it goes through). TTL field is decremented by one each time the datagram is processed by a router. When the value is 0, the packet is automatically destroyed.

    4. If the value in protocol field is 17, the transport layer protocol used is _____________
    <br/>
    a) TCP
    <br/>
    b) UDP
    <br/>
    c) ICMP
    <br/>
    d) IGMP
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The protocol field enables the demultiplexing feature so that the IP protocol can be used to carry payloads of more than one protocol type. Its most used values are 17 and 6 for UDP and TCP respectively. ICMP and IGMP are network layer protocols.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    5. The data field cannot carry which of the following?
    <br/>
    a) TCP segment
    <br/>
    b) UDP segment
    <br/>
    c) ICMP messages
    <br/>
    d) SMTP messages
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Data field usually has transport layer segments, but it can also carry ICMP messages. SMTP is an application layer protocol. First it must go through the transport layer to be converted into TCP segments and then it can be inserted into IP packets.

    6. What should be the flag value to indicate the last fragment?
    <br/>
    a) 0
    <br/>
    b) 1
    <br/>
    c) TTl value
    <br/>
    d) Protocol field value
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The Flag field in the IP header is used to control and identify the fragments. It contains three bits: reserved, don’t fragment and more fragments. If the more fragments bit is 0, it means that the fragment is the last fragment.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    7. Which of these is not applicable for IP protocol?
    <br/>
    a) is connectionless
    <br/>
    b) offer reliable service
    <br/>
    c) offer unreliable service
    <br/>
    d) does not offer error reporting
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: IP does not provide reliable delivery service for the data. It’s dependent upon the transport layer protocols like TCP to offer reliability.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Which of the following demerits does Fragmentation have?
    <br/>
    a) complicates routers
    <br/>
    b) open to DOS attack
    <br/>
    c) overlapping of fragments.
    <br/>
    d) all of the mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Fragmentation makes the implementation of the IP protocol complex and can also be exploited by attackers to create a DOS attack such as a teardrop attack. Fragmentation won’t be required if the transport layer protocols perform wise segmentation.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    9. Which field helps to check rearrangement of the fragments?
    <br/>
    a) offset
    <br/>
    b) flag
    <br/>
    c) ttl
    <br/>
    d) identifer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The Fragment Offset field specifies where the fragment fits in the original datagram. The offset of the first fragment will always be 0. The size of the field (13 bits) is 3-bits shorter than the size of the total length field (16 bits).

    This set of Computer Networks Interview Questions and Answers for Experienced people focuses on “IPv4  Addressing”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Which of these is not applicable for IP protocol?
    <br/>
    a) Connectionless
    <br/>
    b) Offer reliable service
    <br/>
    c) Offer unreliable service
    <br/>
    d) Does not offer error reporting
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: IP does not provide reliable delivery service for the data. It’s dependent upon the transport layer protocols like TCP to offer reliability.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Which of the following demerits does Fragmentation have?
    <br/>
    a) Complicates routers
    <br/>
    b) Open to DOS attack
    <br/>
    c) Overlapping of fragments
    <br/>
    d) All of the mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Fragmentation makes the implementation of the IP protocol complex and can also be exploited by attackers to create a DOS attack such as a teardrop attack. Fragmentation won’t be required if the transport layer protocols perform wise segmentation.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Which field helps to check rearrangement of the fragments?
    <br/>
    a) Offset
    <br/>
    b) Flag
    <br/>
    c) TTL
    <br/>
    d) Identifier
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The Fragment Offset field specifies where the fragment fits in the original datagram. The offset of the first fragment will always be 0. The size of the field (13 bits) is 3-bits shorter than the size of the total length field (16 bits).

    4. In classless addressing, there are no classes but addresses are still granted in ______
    <br/>
    a) IPs
    <br/>
    b) Blocks
    <br/>
    c) Codes
    <br/>
    d) Sizes
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: In classless addressing, there are no classes but addresses are still granted in blocks. The total number of addresses in a block of classless IP addresses = 2
    <sup>
     (32 – CIDR_value)
    </sup>
    .
   </div>
   <p>
    5. In IPv4 Addresses, classful addressing is replaced with ________
    <br/>
    a) Classless Addressing
    <br/>
    b) Classful Addressing
    <br/>
    c) Classful Advertising
    <br/>
    d) Classless Advertising
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Classful addressing is replaced with classless addressing as a large ratio of the available addresses in a class in calssful addressing is wasted. In classless addressing, one can reserve the number of IP addresses required by modifying the CIDR value and make sure that not many addresses are wasted.
   </div>
   <div style="margin:30px 0px;">

    6. First address in a block is used as network address that represents the ________
    <br/>
    a) Class Network
    <br/>
    b) Entity
    <br/>
    c) Organization
    <br/>
    d) Codes
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: First address in a block is used as network address that represents the organization. The network address can be found by AND’ing any address in the block by the default mask. The last address in a block represents the broadcast address.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. In classful addressing, a large part of available addresses are ________
    <br/>
    a) Organized
    <br/>
    b) Blocked
    <br/>
    c) Wasted
    <br/>
    d) Communicated
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: In classful addressing, a large part of available addresses are wasted. Thus to solve this classful addressing is replaced with classless addressing where one can reserve the number of IP addresses required by modifying the CIDR value and make sure that not many addresses are wasted.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Network addresses are a very important concept of ________
    <br/>
    a) Routing
    <br/>
    b) Mask
    <br/>
    c) IP Addressing
    <br/>
    d) Classless Addressing
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Network addresses are a very important concept of IP addressing. The first address in a block is used as network address that represents the organization. The network address can be found by AND’ing any address in the block or class by the default mask.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. Which of this is not a class of IP address?
    <br/>
    a) Class E
    <br/>
    b) Class C
    <br/>
    c) Class D
    <br/>
    d) Class F
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Class F is not a class of IP addressing. There are only five classes of IP addresses: Class A (0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255), Class B (128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255), Class C (192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255), Class D (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255), and Class E (240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255).

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “IPv6”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. The size of an IP address in IPv6 is _________
    <br/>
    a) 4 bytes
    <br/>
    b) 128 bits
    <br/>
    c) 8 bytes
    <br/>
    d) 100 bits
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: An IPv6 address is 128 bits long. Therefore, 2128 i.e. 340 undecillion addresses are possible in IPv6. IPv4 has only 4 billion possible addresses and IPv6 would be a brilliant alternative in case IPv4 runs out of possible new addresses.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    2. The header length of an IPv6 datagram is ___________
    <br/>
    a) 10bytes
    <br/>
    b) 25bytes
    <br/>
    c) 30bytes
    <br/>
    d) 40bytes
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: IPv6 datagram has fixed header length of 40bytes, which results in faster processing of the datagram. There is one fixed header and optional headers which may or may not exist. The fixed header contains the mandatory essential information about the packet while the optional headers contain the optional “not that necessary” information.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    3. In the IPv6 header, the traffic class field is similar to which field in the IPv4 header?
    <br/>
    a) Fragmentation field
    <br/>
    b) Fast-switching
    <br/>
    c) ToS field
    <br/>
    d) Option field
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The traffic class field is used to specify the priority of the IP packet which is a similar functionality to the Type of Service field in the IPv4 header. It’s an 8-bit field and its values are not defined in the RFC 2460.

    4. IPv6 does not use _________ type of address.
    <br/>
    a) broadcast
    <br/>
    b) multicast
    <br/>
    c) anycast
    <br/>
    d) unicast
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: There is no concept of broadcast address in IPv6. Instead, there is an anycast address in IPv6 which allows sending messages to a group of devices but not all devices in a network. Anycast address is not standardized in IPv4.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    5. Which among the following features is present in IPv6 but not in IPv4?
    <br/>
    a) Fragmentation
    <br/>
    b) Header checksum
    <br/>
    c) Options
    <br/>
    d) Anycast address
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: There is an anycast address in IPv6 which allows sending messages to a group of devices but not all devices in a network. Anycast address is not standardized in IPv4.

    6. The _________ field determines the lifetime of IPv6 datagram
    <br/>
    a) Hop limit
    <br/>
    b) TTL
    <br/>
    c) Next header
    <br/>
    d) Type of traffic
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The Hop limit value is decremented by one by a router when the datagram is forwarded by the router. When the value becomes zero the datagram is discarded. The field is 8-bits wide, so an IPv6 packet can live up to 255 router hops only.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    7. Dual-stack approach refers to _________
    <br/>
    a) implementing Ipv4 with 2 stacks
    <br/>
    b) implementing Ipv6 with 2 stacks
    <br/>
    c) node has both IPv4 and IPv6 support
    <br/>
    d) implementing a MAC address with 2 stacks
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Dual-stack is one of the approaches used to support IPv6 in already existing systems. ISPs are using it as a method to transfer from IPv4 to IPv6 completely eventually due to the lower number of possible available addresses in IPv4.

    8. Suppose two IPv6 nodes want to interoperate using IPv6 datagrams, but they are connected to each other by intervening IPv4 routers. The best solution here is ________
    <br/>
    a) Use dual-stack approach
    <br/>
    b) Tunneling
    <br/>
    c) No solution
    <br/>
    d) Replace the system
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The IPv4 routers can form a tunnel in which at the sender’s side, the IPv6 datagram is encapsulated in to IPv4, and at the receiver’s side of the tunnel, the IPv4 packet is stripped and the IPv6 packet is sent to the receiver.

    9. Teredo is an automatic tunneling technique. In each client the obfuscated IPv4 address is represented by bits ______
    <br/>
    a) 96 to 127
    <br/>
    b) 0 to 63
    <br/>
    c) 80 to 95
    <br/>
    d) 64 to 79
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Teredo is a technique through which gives the possibility for full IPv6 network connectivity to IPv6 capable hosts which are currently on an IPv4 network. Bits 96 to 127 in the datagram represents obfuscated 1Pv4 address of the IPv4 network.

    5. In subcategories of reserved address in IPv6, address that is used by a host to test itself without going into network is called _________
    <br/>
    a) Unspecified address
    <br/>
    b) Loopback address
    <br/>
    c) Compatible address
    <br/>
    d) Mapped address
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: In subcategories of reserved address in IPv6, address that is used by a host to test itself without going into network is called loop back address. IPv6 loopback address is 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001. IPv4 loopback address is 127.0.0.1. It’s a reserved address.

    <br/>
    a) Prefix type
    <br/>
    b) Postfix type
    <br/>
    c) Reserved type
    <br/>
    d) Local type
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Prefix is the bits in the IP address which are placed in leftmost position. A network prefix in IPv6 is given by a CIDR format-liked number at the end of the address.

    7. In IPv6 addresses, addresses that start with eight 0s are called ________
    <br/>
    a) Unicast addresses
    <br/>
    b) Multicast addresses
    <br/>
    c) Any cast addresses
    <br/>
    d) Reserved addresses
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: In IPv6 address format, the starting bits are specified with eight 0s to represent reserved addresses. These reserved addresses have a certain function pre-defined like the loop-back address is used to test a network card. Reserved addresses cannot be allotted to a machine.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Which statement(s) about IPv6 addresses are true?
    <br/>
    a) Leading zeros are required
    <br/>
    b) Two colons (::) are used to represent successive hexadecimal fields of zeros
    <br/>
    c) Two colons (::) are used to separate fields
    <br/>
    d) A single interface cannot have multiple IPv6 addresses of different types
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: In order to shorten the written length of an IPv6 address, successive fields of zeros may be replaced by double colons. In trying to shorten the address further, leading zeros may also be removed. Just as with IPv4, a single device’s interface can have more than one address; with IPv6 there are more types of addresses and the same rule applies. There can be link-local, global unicast, and multicast addresses all assigned to the same interface.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. When was IPv6 launched?
    <br/>
    a) June 2, 2012
    <br/>
    b) June 4, 2012
    <br/>
    c) June 5, 2012
    <br/>
    d) June 6, 2012
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol released on 6
    <sup>
     th
    </sup>
    June 2012. An IPv6 address is 128 bits long. Therefore, 2
    <sup>
     128
    </sup>
    i.e. 340 undecillion addresses are possible in IPv6.

    <br/>
    b) Network layer
    <br/>
    c) Transport layer
    <br/>
    d) Application layer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The transport layer is responsible for process-to-process delivery, error control and flow control. It provides an interface for the implementation of process to process delivery through ports. There are 65,535 port numbers.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. In process-to-process delivery, two processes communicate in which of the following methods?
    <br/>
    a) Client/Server
    <br/>
    b) Source/Destination
    <br/>

    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The most common method used for this communication is Client/Server. The client requests a service through a particular port number to the port of the server using its socket address. Then the server responds by giving the requested service to the client port.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Multiple processes on destinations at transport layer are identified by __________
    <br/>
    a) Mac address
    <br/>
    b) Port number
    <br/>
    c) Host number
    <br/>

    b) 0 and 32,765(16-bit)
    <br/>
    c) 0 and 65,535(32-bit)
    <br/>
    d) 0 and 65,535(16-bit)
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Port numbers are 16-bit integers between 0 and 65,535. They are an interface for the implementation of process to process delivery for the transport layer.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. According to Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which of the following ranges is not a part of port number ranges?
    <br/>
    a) Well-known ports
    <br/>
    b) Registered ports
    <br/>
    c) Dynamic ports
    <br/>
    d) Static ports
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: IANA divided port numbers into three ranges i.e., Well-known, Registered and Dynamic ports. Well-known port numbers range from 0 to 1023, registered port numbers are from 1024 to 49151 and dynamic port numbers are from 49152 to 65535.

    7. Which of the following is false with respect to Connectionless service of transport layer protocol?
    <br/>
    a) Packets are not numbered
    <br/>
    b) Packets are not delayed
    <br/>
    c) No acknowledgement
    <br/>
    d) Packet may arrive out of sequence
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: There is a high probability in connectionless services like UDP that the packet gets delayed or lost because there is no connection made between the two end nodes. No connection means that there is no unique pathway for the packets to travel.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Correct order in the process of Connection-Oriented services is ________
    <br/>
    i. Data transfer
    <br/>
    ii. Connection release
    <br/>
    iii. Connection establishment
    <br/>
    a) i-ii-iii
    <br/>
    b) iii-ii-i
    <br/>
    c) ii-i-iii
    <br/>
    d) iii-i-ii
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: First the client has to request a connection and the server has to accept the connection to establish a connection. Then data transfer can start between the two ends. Then both client and server need to terminate their ends to terminate the connection.
   </div>

    9. In transport layer, Multiplexing is done at _________
    <br/>
    a) Channel
    <br/>
    b) Receiver site
    <br/>
    c) Sender site
    <br/>
    d) Packet
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: At the sender’s side, there are multiple processes which may want to send packets. But there is only one transport layer protocol like TCP or UDP working at a time. So the transport layer protocol gets the messages from these processes and separates them with different port numbers. This process is called multiplexing and it is done before sending packets to the receivers side.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. The process of error checking and dropping of the header, delivering messages to appropriate process based on port number is called as _______
    <br/>
    a) Delivery of packets
    <br/>
    b) Error correction
    <br/>
    c) Multiplexing
    <br/>
    d) Demultiplexing
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Demultiplexing is the process of error checking and dropping of the header, delivering messages to appropriate process based on port number. The transport layer does this on the receiver’s end after the packet is received and takes help of the header attached by the sender’s side transport layer during multiplexing.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “ICMP”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) has been designed to compensate _________
    <br/>
    a) Error-reporting
    <br/>
    b) Error-correction
    <br/>
    c) Host and management queries
    <br/>
    d) All of the mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: IP by itself does not provide the features of error reporting or error correction. So, to address these issues a network layer protocol called Internet Control Message Protocol is used. ICMP operates over the IP packet to provide error reporting functionality.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Header size of the ICMP message is _________
    <br/>
    a) 8-bytes
    <br/>
    b) 8-bits
    <br/>
    c) 16-bytes
    <br/>
    d) 16-bits
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: An ICMP message has an 8-byte header and a variable size data section. Out of the 8 bytes, the first 4 bytes are of a fixed format having the type, code and checksum fields and the next 4 bytes depend upon the type of the message.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. During error reporting, ICMP always reports error messages to ________
    <br/>
    a) Destination
    <br/>
    b) Source
    <br/>
    c) Next router
    <br/>
    d) Previous router
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: ICMP notifies the source about the error when an error is detected because the datagram knows information about source and destination IP address. The source can then retransmit the data again or try to correct those errors.

    4. Which of these is not a type of error-reporting message?
    <br/>
    a) Destination unreachable
    <br/>
    b) Source quench
    <br/>
    c) Router error
    <br/>
    d) Time exceeded
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Router error is not a type of error-reporting message in ICMP. The type of error reporting message is specified in the ICMP header. Destination unreachable is type 3 error message, source quench is type 4, and time exceeded is type 11 error message.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. ICMP error message will not be generated for a datagram having a special address such as _______
    <br/>
    a) 127.0.0.0
    <br/>
    b) 12.1.2
    <br/>
    c) 11.1
    <br/>
    d) 127
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: 127.0.0.0 is a special address known as the loopback address which is used for testing purpose of a machine without actually communicating with a network. Thus no error reporting message will be generated for such special addresses.

    6. When a router cannot route a datagram or host cannot deliver a datagram, the datagram is discarded and the router or the host sends a ____________ message back to the source host that initiated the datagram.
    <br/>
    a) Destination unreachable
    <br/>
    b) Source quench
    <br/>
    c) Router error
    <br/>
    d) Time exceeded
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Router sends destination unreachable message if the destination is not found. Destination unreachable is type 3 error reporting message. It is invoked when the router can’t find a path to the intended destination to forward the packet through.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. The source-quench message in ICMP was designed to add a kind of ____________ to the IP.
    <br/>
    a) error control
    <br/>
    b) flow control
    <br/>
    c) router control
    <br/>
    d) switch control
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Firstly, it informs the source that the datagram has been discarded. Secondly, it warns the source that there is congestion in the network. It’s type 4 error reporting message after which the source is expected to reduce the flow of packets.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. In case of time exceeded error, when the datagram visits a router, the value of time to live field is _________
    <br/>
    a) Remains constant
    <br/>
    b) Decremented by 2
    <br/>
    c) Incremented by 1
    <br/>
    d) Decremented by 1
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: This field will be decremented by 1 at every router, and will be zero by the time it reaches source. This error reporting message is type 11 and is used to prevent the router from travelling forever in case some unknown path anomaly occurs.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. Two machines can use the timestamp request and timestamp replay messages to determine the ___________ needed for an IP datagram to travel between them.
    <br/>
    a) Half-trip time
    <br/>
    b) Round-trip time
    <br/>
    c) Travel time for the next router
    <br/>
    d) Time to reach the destination/source
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The round-trip time refers to the total time taken combining the time taken for a packet sent from a source to reach a destination and the time taken the acknowledgement sent by the destination to reach the source. The Router sends destination unreachable message if the destination is not found.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. During debugging, we can use the ____________ program to find if a host is alive and responding.
    <br/>
    a) traceroute
    <br/>
    b) shell
    <br/>
    c) ping
    <br/>
    d) java
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Ping program is used to find if a host is alive and responding. It is to be entered into a command line with the syntax “ping (IP address)” to be executed. Traceroute is a program used to find the shortest route to the destination IP.
   </div>
   <p>
    11. In windows  ____________ can be used to trace the route of the packet from the source to the destination.
    <br/>
    a) traceroute
    <br/>
    b) tracert
    <br/>
    c) ping
    <br/>
    d) locater
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Tracert is used in case of windows, whereas Traceroute in UNIX. Tracert is a program used to find the shortest route to the destination IP. The Router sends destination unreachable message if a path to the destination IP is not found.

    <br/>
    Explanation: The sender side adds the bits of the fragmented packet to find a sum. Checksum is the compliment of the sum (exchange 0’s and 1’s). The receiver then has to verify the checksum by adding the bits of the received packet to ensure that the packet is error-free.

    This set of Computer Networks Quiz focuses on “Transition from IPV4 to IPV6”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. The main reason for transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is _________
    <br/>
    a) Huge number of systems on the internet
    <br/>
    b) Very low number of system on the internet
    <br/>
    c) Providing standard address
    <br/>
    d) To provide faster internet
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Due to huge number of systems on the internet and the lower number of available addresses on IPv4, transition from IPv4 to IPv6 needs to happen. IPv4 provides around 4 billion unique IP addresses whereas IPv6 provides over 340 undecillion unique IP addresses.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Which of the following is not a transition strategy?
    <br/>
    a) Dual stack
    <br/>
    b) Tunneling
    <br/>
    c) Conversion
    <br/>
    d) Header translation
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: As IPv4 addresses are of 32 bits and IPv6 addresses are of 128 bits, it is not possible to convert IPv4 address to IPv6 address. So, Dual stack, tunneling and header translation are the three strategies which might help in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. To determine which version to use when sending a packet to a destination, the source host queries which of the following?
    <br/>
    a) Dual stack
    <br/>
    b) Domain Name Server
    <br/>
    c) Header information
    <br/>
    d) Transport layer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Source host queries DNS to determine which version to use when sending a packet to a destination. The DNS contains both, the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the modern dual stack host servers.

    4. The strategy used when two computers using IPv6 want to communicate with each other and the packet must pass through a region that uses IPv4 is ______________
    <br/>
    a) Dual stack
    <br/>
    b) Header translation
    <br/>
    c) Conversion
    <br/>
    d) Tunneling
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: In tunneling, The IPv4 routers can form a tunnel in which at the sender’s side, the IPv6 datagram is encapsulated in to IPv4, and at the receiver’s side of the tunnel, the IPv4 packet is stripped and the IPv6 packet is sent to the receiver.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. The correct format of packet in tunnel that uses IPv4 region is ________
    <br/>
    i. IPv6 header
    <br/>
    ii. Payload
    <br/>
    iii. IPv4 header
    <br/>
    a) iii-i-ii
    <br/>
    b) iii-ii-i
    <br/>
    c) i-ii-iii
    <br/>
    d) i-iii-ii
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: At the sender’s side, the IPv6 datagram is encapsulated in to IPv4 i.e. An IPv4 header is inserted on top of the IPv6 header, and then the packet is sent through the tunnel.

    6. ___________ is necessary when the sender wants to use IPv6, but the receiver does not understand IPv6.
    <br/>
    a) Dual stack
    <br/>
    b) Header translation
    <br/>
    c) Conversion
    <br/>
    d) Tunneling
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Header translation is used when the sender wants to use IPv6, but the receiver does not understand IPv6. It is made possible through a Network Address Translation – Protocol Translation enabled device such as a gateway.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. Header translation uses ___________ to translate an IPv6 address to an IPv4 address.
    <br/>
    a) IP address
    <br/>
    b) Physical address
    <br/>
    c) Mapped address
    <br/>
    d) MAC address
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: A mapped IPv6 address contains the IPv4 address in its last 32-bits and is preceded by 16 1s and 80 0s. It can be used to translate an IPv6 address to an IPv4 address.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Which of the following is not a step in the Header translation procedure?
    <br/>
    a) The IPv6 mapped address is changed to an IPv4 address by extracting the rightmost 32bits
    <br/>
    b) The value of the IPv6 priority field is discarded
    <br/>
    c) The type of service field in IPv4 is set to zero
    <br/>
    d) The IPv6 flow label is considered
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: In the header translation procedure, first the IPv6 mapped address is changed to an IPv4 address by extracting the rightmost 32bits, then the value of the IPv6 priority field is discarded, and finally the ToS field in the IPv4 header is set to zero. IPv6 flow label is ignored in the procedure.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “IPV4 and IPV6 Comparision”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Which of the following is not applicable for IP?
    <br/>
    a) Error reporting
    <br/>
    b) Handle addressing conventions
    <br/>
    c) Datagram format
    <br/>
    d) Packet handling
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The Internet Protocol is the networking protocol that establishes the internet by relaying datagram across network boundaries. ICMP is a supporting protocol for IP which handles the Error Reporting functionality.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Which of the following field in IPv4 datagram is not related to fragmentation?
    <br/>
    a) Flags
    <br/>
    b) Offset
    <br/>
    c) TOS
    <br/>
    d) Identifier
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: TOS-type of service identifies the type of packets. It is not related to fragmentation but is used to request specific treatment such as high throughput, high reliability or low latency for the IP packet depending upon the type of service it belongs to.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. The TTL field has value 10. How many routers (max) can process this datagram?
    <br/>
    a) 11
    <br/>
    b) 5
    <br/>
    c) 10
    <br/>
    d) 1
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: TTL stands for Time to Live. This field specifies the life of the IP packet based on the number of hops it makes (Number of routers it goes through). TTL field is decremented by one each time the datagram is processed by a router. When the value is 0, the packet is automatically destroyed.

    4. If the value in protocol field is 17, the transport layer protocol used is _________
    <br/>
    a) TCP
    <br/>
    b) UDP
    <br/>
    c) ICMP
    <br/>
    d) IGMP
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The protocol field enables the demultiplexing feature so that the IP protocol can be used to carry payloads of more than one protocol type. Its most used values are 17 and 6 for UDP and TCP respectively. ICMP and IGMP are network layer protocols.

    5. Which field helps to check rearrangement of the fragments?
    <br/>
    a) offset
    <br/>
    b) flag
    <br/>
    c) ttl
    <br/>
    d) identifier
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The Fragment Offset field specifies where the fragment fits in the original datagram. The offset of the first fragment will always be 0. The size of the field (13 bits) is 3-bits shorter than the size of the total length field (16 bits).

    6. The size of an IP address in IPv6 is _________
    <br/>
    a) 4bytes
    <br/>
    b) 128bits
    <br/>
    c) 8bytes
    <br/>
    d) 100bits
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: An IPv6 address is 128 bits long. Therefore, 2
    <sup>
     128
    </sup>
    i.e. 340 undecillion unique addresses are available in IPv6. IPv4 has only 4 billion possible addresses and IPv6 would be a brilliant alternative in case IPv4 runs out of possible new addresses.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. The header length of an IPv6 datagram is ___________
    <br/>
    a) 10bytes
    <br/>
    b) 25bytes
    <br/>
    c) 30bytes
    <br/>
    d) 40bytes
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: IPv6 datagram has fixed header length of 40bytes, which results in faster processing of the datagram. There is one fixed header and optional headers which may or may not exist. The fixed header contains the mandatory essential information about the packet while the optional headers contain the optional “not that necessary” information.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. In an IPv6 header, the traffic class field is similar to which field in the IPv4 header?
    <br/>
    a) Fragmentation field
    <br/>
    b) Fast switching
    <br/>
    c) TOS field
    <br/>
    d) Option field
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The traffic class field is used to specify the priority of the IP packet which is a similar functionality to the Type of Service field in the IPv4 header. It’s an 8-bit field and its values are not defined in the RFC 2460.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. IPv6 does not use ________ type of address.
    <br/>
    a) Broadcast
    <br/>
    b) Multicast
    <br/>
    c) Any cast
    <br/>
    d) Unicast
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: There is no concept of broadcast address in IPv6. Instead, there is an anycast address in IPv6 which allows sending messages to a group of devices but not all devices in a network. Anycast address is not standardized in IPv4.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. Which are the features present in IPv4 but not in IPv6?
    <br/>
    a) Fragmentation
    <br/>
    b) Header checksum
    <br/>
    c) Options
    <br/>
    d) Anycast address
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: There is an anycast address in IPv6 which allows sending messages to a group of devices but not all devices in a network. Anycast address is not standardized in IPv4.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Analyzing Subnet Masks”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Which of the following is the broadcast address for a Class B network ID using the default subnetmask?
    <br/>
    a) 172.16.10.255
    <br/>
    b) 255.255.255.255
    <br/>
    c) 172.16.255.255
    <br/>
    d) 172.255.255.255
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: In this case, the class B network ID is 172.16.0.0. We know that the default mask of a class B network is 255.255.0.0. If we OR any address in a network with the complement of the default mask (0.0.255.255), we get the broadcast address of the network. In this case, the result of OR would be 172.16.255.255.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. You have an IP address of 172.16.13.5 with a 255.255.255.128 subnet mask. What is your class of address, subnet address, and broadcast address?
    <br/>
    a) Class A, Subnet 172.16.13.0, Broadcast address 172.16.13.127
    <br/>
    b) Class B, Subnet 172.16.13.0, Broadcast address 172.16.13.127
    <br/>
    c) Class B, Subnet 172.16.13.0, Broadcast address 172.16.13.255
    <br/>
    d) Class B, Subnet 172.16.0.0, Broadcast address 172.16.255.255
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: We know that the prefix 172 lies in class B (128 to 191) of IPv4 addresses. From the subnet mask, we get that the class is divided into 2 subnets: 172.16.13.0 to 172.16.13.127 and 172.16.13.128 to 172.16.13.255. The IP 172.16.13.5 lies in the first subnet. So the starting address 172.16.13.0 is the subnet address and last address 172.16.13.127 is the broadcast address.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. If you wanted to have 12 subnets with a Class C network ID, which subnet mask would you use?
    <br/>
    a) 255.255.255.252
    <br/>
    b) 255.255.255.255
    <br/>
    c) 255.255.255.240
    <br/>
    d) 255.255.255.248
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: If you have eight networks and each requires 10 hosts, you would use the Class C mask of 255.255.255.240. Why? Because 240 in binary is 11110000, which means you have four subnet bits and four host bits. Using our math, we’d get the following:
    <br/>
    24-2=14 subnets
    <br/>
    24-2=14 hosts.
   </div>
   <p>
    4. The combination of _________ and __________ is often termed the local address of the local portion of the IP address.
    <br/>
    a) Network number and host number
    <br/>
    b) Network number and subnet number
    <br/>
    c) Subnet number and host number
    <br/>
    d) Host number
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: It is termed as the local address because the address won’t be applicable outside the subnet. Sub networking is implemented for remote sensing in transparent way from that host which is contained in the sub network which called a local operation.

    5. _________ implies that all subnets obtained from the same subnet mask.
    <br/>
    a) Static subnetting
    <br/>
    b) Dynamic subnetting
    <br/>
    c) Variable length subnetting
    <br/>
    d) Dynamic length subnetting
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Static subnetting is used when the requirement is of same number of hosts in each subnet for the institution. The same subnet mask can be used to find the subnet id of each subnet. It is usually used to divide large networks into smaller parts.

    6. State whether true or false.
    <br/>
    i) A connection oriented protocol can only use unicast addresses.
    <br/>
    ii) The any cast service is included in IPV6.
    <br/>
    a) True, True
    <br/>
    b) True, False

    c) False, True
    <br/>
    d) False, False
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In a connection oriented protocol, the host can only establish connection with another host on one unique channel, that’s why it can only use unicast addresses. In IPv6, there is an anycast address in IPv6 which allows sending messages to a group of devices but not all devices in a network.

    d) All of the mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: In computer networking, Gigabit Ethernet (GbE or 1 GigE) is a term describing various technologies for transmitting Ethernet frames at a rate of a gigabit per second (1,000,000,000 bits per second), as defined by the IEEE 802.3-2008 standard. It came into use beginning in 1999, gradually supplanting Fast Ethernet in wired local networks, as a result of being considerably faster.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. _________ is a collective term for a number of Ethernet Standards that carry traffic at the nominal rate of 1000 Mbit/s against the original Ethernet speed of 10 Mbit/s.
    <br/>

    <br/>
    c) NET/SW
    <br/>
    d) FS/NET
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: A 50-MBd active star fiber optical Local area network (LAN) and its optical combiner and mixing rod splitter are presented. The limited power budget and relatively large tapping losses of light wave technology, which limit the use of fiber optics in tapped bus LAN topologies, are examined and proven tolerable in optical star topologies.

   <pre>i. A crossover cable should be used in place of the straight-through cable.
ii. A rollover cable should be used in place of the straight-through cable.
iii. The subnet masks should be set to 255.255.255.192.
iv. A default gateway needs to be set on each host.
v. The subnet masks should be set to 255.255.255.0.
</pre>
   <p>
    a) i only
    <br/>
    b) ii only
    <br/>
    c) iii and iv only
    <br/>
    d) i and v only
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: First, if you have two hosts directly connected, as shown in the graphic, then you need a crossover cable. A straight-through cable won’t work. Second, the hosts have different masks, which puts them in different subnets. The easy solution is just to set both masks to 255.255.255.0 (/24).

    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The router’s IP address on the E0 interface is 172.16.2.1/23, which is 255.255.254.0. This makes the third octet a block size of 2. The router’s interface is in the 172.16.2.0 subnet, and the broadcast address is 172.16.3.255 because the next subnet is 172.16.4.0. The valid host range is 172.16.2.1 to 172.16.3.254. The router is using the first valid host address in the range.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Which two statements describe the IP address 10.16.3.65/23?
   </p>
   <pre>i. The subnet address is 10.16.3.0 255.255.254.0.
ii. The lowest host address in the subnet is 10.16.2.1 255.255.254.0.
iii. The last valid host address in the subnet is 10.16.2.254 255.255.254.0.
iv. The broadcast address of the subnet is 10.16.3.255 255.255.254.0.

    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The mask 255.255.254.0 (/23) used with a Class A address means that there are 15 subnet bits and 9 host bits. The block size in the third octet is 2 (256 – 254). So this makes the subnets in the interesting octet 0, 2, 4, 6, etc., all the way to 254. The host 10.16.3.65 is in the 10.16.2.0 subnet. The next subnet is 10.16.4.0, so the broadcast address for the 10.16.2.0 subnet is 10.16.3.255. The valid host addresses are 10.16.2.1 to 10.16.3.254.
   </div>
   <p>
    4. What is the maximum number of IP addresses that can be assigned to hosts on a local subnet that uses the 255.255.255.224 subnet mask?
    <br/>
    a) 14
    <br/>
    b) 15
    <br/>
    c) 16
    <br/>
    d) 30
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: A /27 (255.255.255.224) is 3 bits on and 5 bits off. This provides 8 subnets, each with 30 hosts. Does it matter if this mask is used with a Class A, B, or C network address? Not at all. The number of host bits would never change.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. You need to subnet a network into 5 subnets, each with at least 16 hosts. Which classful subnet mask would you use?
    <br/>
    a) 255.255.255.192
    <br/>
    b) 255.255.255.224
    <br/>
    c) 255.255.255.240
    <br/>
    d) 255.255.255.248
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: You need 5 subnets, each with at least 16 hosts. The mask 255.255.255.240 provides 16 subnets with 14 hosts which is less than 15, so this will not work. The mask 255.255.255.224 provides 8 subnets, each with 30 hosts so this may work. The mask 255.255.255.192 provides 4 subnets, each with 60 hosts so this may work. Comparing both the possible masks, 255.255.255.224 provides the best answer.
   </div>
   <p>
    6. You have a network that needs 29 subnets while maximizing the number of host addresses available on each subnet. How many bits must you borrow from the host field to provide the correct subnet mask?
    <br/>
    a) 2
    <br/>
    b) 3
    <br/>
    c) 4
    <br/>
    d) 5
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: A 240 mask is 4 subnet bits and provides 16 subnets, each with 14 hosts. We need more subnets, so let’s add subnet bits. One more subnet bit would be a 248 mask. This provides 5 subnet bits (32 subnets) with 3 host bits (6 hosts per subnet). This is the best answer.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. If an Ethernet port on a router were assigned an IP address of 172.16.112.1/25, what would be the valid subnet address of this host?
    <br/>
    a) 172.16.112.0
    <br/>
    b) 172.16.0.0
    <br/>
    c) 172.16.96.0
    <br/>
    d) 172.16.255.0
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: A /25 mask is 255.255.255.128. Used with a Class B network, the third and fourth octets are used for subnetting with a total of 9 subnet bits, 8 bits in the third octet and 1 bit in the fourth octet. Since there is only 1 bit in the fourth octet, the bit is either off or on-which is a value of 0 or 128. The host in the question is in the 0 subnet, which has a broadcast address of 127 since 128 is the next subnet
   </div>
   <p>
    8. You have an interface on a router with the IP address of 192.168.192.10/29. Including the router interface, how many hosts can have IP addresses on the LAN attached to the router interface?
    <br/>
    a) 6
    <br/>
    b) 8
    <br/>
    c) 30
    <br/>
    d) 32
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: A /29 (255.255.255.248), regardless of the class of address, has only 3 host bits. Six hosts are the maximum number of hosts on this LAN, including the router interface. Out of the 8 addresses possible with the host bits, the first and the last address are for the subnet id and broadcast address respectively.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. What is the subnet id of a host with an IP address 172.16.66.0/21?
    <br/>
    a) 172.16.36.0
    <br/>
    b) 172.16.48.0
    <br/>
    c) 172.16.64.0
    <br/>
    d) 172.16.0.0
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: A /21 is 255.255.248.0, which means we have a block size of 8 in the third octet, so we just count by 8 until we reach 66. The subnet in this question is 64.0. The next subnet is 72.0, so the broadcast address of the 64 subnet is 71.255.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. The network address of 172.16.0.0/19 provides how many subnets and hosts?
    <br/>
    a) 7 subnets, 30 hosts each
    <br/>
    b) 8 subnets, 8,190 hosts each
    <br/>
    c) 8 subnets, 2,046 hosts each
    <br/>
    d) 7 subnets, 2,046 hosts each
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: A CIDR address of /19 is 255.255.224.0. This is a Class B address, so that is only 3 subnet bits, but it provides 13 host bits, or 8 subnets, each with 8,190 hosts.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “IP Routing”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Which type of Ethernet framing is used for TCP/IP and DEC net?
    <br/>
    a) Ethernet 802.3
    <br/>
    b) Ethernet 802.2
    <br/>
    c) Ethernet II
    <br/>
    d) Ethernet SNAP
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The Ethernet 802.3 framing is used for NetWare versions 2 to 3.11, and the Ethernet 802.2 framing is used for NetWare versions 3.12 and later plus OSI routing, Ethernet II is used with TCP/IP and DEC net, and Ethernet SNAP is used with TCP/IP and AppleTalk. The type field in Ethernet 802.2 frame is replaced by a length field in Ethernet 802.3.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Consider a situation in which you are a system administrator on a NetWare network, you are running NetWare 4.11 and you cannot communicate with your router. What is the likely problem?
    <br/>
    a) NetWare 4.11 defaults to 802.2 encapsulation
    <br/>
    b) NetWare 4.11 defaults to 802.3 encapsulation
    <br/>
    c) Cisco routers only work with NetWare 3.11
    <br/>
    d) NetWare 3.11 defaults to 802.2 encapsulation
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The default encapsulation on Cisco routers is Novell Ethernet_802.3 and NetWare 3.12and later defaults to 802.2 encapsulation, 3.11 and earlier defaults to 802.3.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. NetWare IPX addressing uses a network number and a node number. Which statement is not true?
    <br/>
    a) The network address is administratively assigned and can be up to 16 hexadecimal digits long
    <br/>
    b) The node address is always administratively assigned
    <br/>
    c) The node address is usually the MAC address
    <br/>
    d) If the MAC address is used as the node address, then IPX eliminates the use of ARP
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The network address can be up to 16 hexadecimal digits in length. The node number is 12 hexadecimal digits. The node address is usually the MAC address. An example IPX address is 4a1d.0000.0c56.de33. The network part is 4a1d. The node part is 0000.0c56.de33. The network number is assigned by the system administrator of the Novell network and the MAC address/node address is not assigned by the administrator.
   </div>
   <p>

    <br/>
    a) NLSP
    <br/>
    b) RIP
    <br/>
    c) SAP
    <br/>
    d) NCP
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>

    6. As a system administrator, you want to debug IGRP but are worried that the “debug IP IGRP transaction” command will flood the console. What is the command that you should use?
    <br/>
    a) Debug IP IGRP event
    <br/>
    b) Debug IP IGRP-events
    <br/>
    c) Debug IP IGRP summary
    <br/>
    d) Debug IP IGRP events
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The “debug IP IGRP events” is used to display a short summary of IGRP routing information. You can append an IP address onto either console’s command-line to see only the IGRP updates from a neighbor. The command will only give a short summary and hence won’t flood the command line.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. What does the following series of commands “Router IGRP 71 network” accomplish?
    <br/>
    10.0.0.0 router IGRP 109 network 172.68.7.0
    <br/>
    a) It isolates networks 10.0.0.0 and 172.68.7.0
    <br/>
    b) It loads IGRP for networks 109 and 71
    <br/>
    c) It disables RIP
    <br/>
    d) It disables all routing protocols
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: It isolates network 10.0.0.0 and 172.68.7.0 and associates autonomous systems 109 and71 with IGRP. IGRP does not disable RIP, both can be used at the same time.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. The “IPX delay number” command will allow an administrator to change the default settings. What are the default settings?
    <br/>

    <br/>
    d) Both arpa and snap are enabled by default so you don’t have to configure anything
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: To assign multiple network numbers, you usually use sub interfaces. A sample configuration follows: IPXEthernet 0.1 IPX encapsulation novell-ether ipx network 9e interface ethernet 0.2 ipx encapsulation sap ipx network 6c
   </div>
   <p>
    12. By default, Cisco routers forward GNS SAPs to remote networks.
    <br/>
    a) False
    <br/>
    b) True
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: GNS is Novell’s protocol to Get Nearest Server. If there is a server on the local network,that server will respond. If there isn’t, the Cisco router has to be configured to forward theGNS SAP.
   </div>
   <p>
    13. To prevent Service Advertisements (SAPs) from flooding a network, Cisco routers do not forward them. How are services advertised to other networks?
    <br/>
    a) Each router builds its own SAP table and forwards that every 60 seconds
    <br/>
    b) Each router assigns a service number and broadcasts that
    <br/>
    c) SAPs aren’t necessary with Cisco routers
    <br/>
    d) Cisco routers filter out all SAPs
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Cisco routers build SAP tables and forward the table every 60 seconds. All SAPs can’t befiltered even with 4.x since NDS and time synchronization uses SAPs.
   </div>
   <p>
    14. Novell’s implementation of RIP updates routing tables every _________ seconds.
    <br/>
    a) 60
    <br/>
    b) 90
    <br/>
    c) 10
    <br/>
    d) 30
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Novell’s RIP updates routing tables every 60 seconds, Apple’s RTMP is every 10 seconds, routers ARP every 60 seconds, IGRP signal every 90 seconds, and Banyan VINES signals every 90 seconds.
   </div>
   <p>
    15. In Novell’s use of RIP, there are two metrics used to make routing decisions. Select the correct metrics.
    <br/>
    a) Ticks &amp; Hops
    <br/>
    b) Hops &amp; Loops
    <br/>
    c) Loops &amp; Counts
    <br/>
    d) Counts &amp; Ticks
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: It first uses ticks (which is about 1/18 sec.); if there is a tie, it uses hops; if hops are equal, then it uses an administratively assigned tiebreaker.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “RIP v1”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Which routing protocol has a maximum network diameter (hop count) of 15?
    <br/>
    a) RIPv1
    <br/>
    b) RIPv2
    <br/>
    c) EIGRP
    <br/>
    d) Both RIPv1 and RIPv2
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Both RIPv1 and RIPv2 support a maximum hop count of 15 because they use 4-bits to store this value. RIPv1 uses classful routing whereas RIPv2 uses classless routing. The routing updates are broadcasted over the network. It notifies routers about the update so that they update their own routing tables.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. How often does a RIPv1 router broadcast its routing table by default?
    <br/>
    a) Every 30 seconds
    <br/>
    b) Every 60 seconds
    <br/>
    c) Every 90 seconds
    <br/>
    d) RIPv1 does not broadcast periodically
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: RIPv1 router broadcasts its routing table every 30 seconds by default. The broadcasted routing table can be used by other routers to find the shortest path among the network devices.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Which command displays RIP routing updates?
    <br/>
    a) Show IP route
    <br/>
    b) Debug IP rip
    <br/>
    c) Show protocols
    <br/>
    d) Debug IP route
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The debug IP rip command is used to show the Internet Protocol (IP) Routing Information Protocol (RIP) updates being sent and received on the router. It verifies that the updates are being broadcasted and not multicasted.

    4. Two connected routers are configured with RIP routing. What will be the result when a router receives a routing update that contains a higher-cost path to a network already in its routing table?
    <br/>
    a) The updated information will be added to the existing routing table Debug IP rip
    <br/>
    b) The update will be ignored and no further action will occur Debug IP route
    <br/>
    c) The updated information will replace the existing routing table entry
    <br/>
    d) The existing routing table entry will be deleted from the routing table and all routers will exchange routing updates to reach convergence
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: When a routing update is received by a router, the router first checks the administrative distance (AD) and always chooses the route with the lowest AD. However, if two routes are received and they both have the same AD, then the router will choose the one route with the lowest metrics, or in RIP’s case, hop count.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. You type debug IP rip on your router console and see that 172.16.10.0 is being advertised to you with a metric of 16. What does this mean?
    <br/>
    a) The route is 16 hops away Debug IP rip
    <br/>
    b) The route has a delay of 16 microseconds Debug IP route
    <br/>
    c) The route is inaccessible
    <br/>
    d) The route is queued at 16 messages a second
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: You cannot have 16 hops on a RIP network by default, because the max default hops possible is 15. If you receive a route advertised with a metric of 16, this means it is inaccessible.

    a) 0
    <br/>
    b) 90
    <br/>
    c) 100
    <br/>
    d) 1
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: 1 is the default administrative distance of Static Route. It is used by routers to select the best path when there are different routes to the same destination. It’s used only two different routing protocols are being used.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. Which protocol gives a full route table update every 30 seconds?
    <br/>
    a) IEGRP
    <br/>
    b) RIP
    <br/>
    c) ICMP
    <br/>
    d) IP
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: RIP gives a full route table update every 30 seconds. The broadcasted routing table can be used by other routers to find the shortest path among the network devices.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. _________ is the default administrative distance of RIP.
    <br/>
    a) 0
    <br/>
    b) 90
    <br/>
    c) 120
    <br/>
    d) 130
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The default administrative distance is the default count of numbers assigned to arbitrary routes to a destination. The default administrative distance of RIP is 120. It is used to find the shortest route amongst the number of paths available.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. Which statement is true regarding classless routing protocol?
    <br/>
    a) The use of discontinuous networks is not allowed
    <br/>
    b) Use of variable length subnet masks is permitted
    <br/>
    c) RIPv1 is a classless routing protocol
    <br/>
    d) IGRP supports classes routing within the same autonomous system
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Use of variable length subnet masks is permitted in classless routing protocols. Also use of discontinuous networks is allowed in such routing protocols. RIPv1 is a classful routing protocol but RIPv2 is classless routing protocol.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. Where should we use default routing?
    <br/>
    a) On stub networks- which have only one exit path out of the network
    <br/>
    b) Which have more than one exit path out of the network
    <br/>
    c) Minimum five exit paths out of the network
    <br/>
    d) Maximum five exit paths out of the network
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: We must use default routing on stub networks. They have only one exit path out of the network, so there can be no specific path decided for such networks.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers focuses on “RIP v2”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Which statement is true regarding classless routing protocols?
    <br/>
    a) The use of discontinuous networks is not allowed
    <br/>
    b) The use of variable length subnet masks is permitted
    <br/>
    c) RIPv1 is a classless routing protocol
    <br/>
    d) RIPv2 supports classless routing
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Classful routing means that all hosts in the internetwork use the same mask. Classless routing means that you can use Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSMs) and can also support discontinuous networking.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. What is route poisoning?
    <br/>
    a) It sends back the protocol received from a router as a poison pill, which stops the regular updates. The use of variable length subnet masks is permitted
    <br/>
    b) It is information received from a router that can’t be sent back to the originating router.RIPv2 supports classless routing
    <br/>
    c) It prevents regular update messages from reinstating a route that has just come up
    <br/>
    d) It describes when a router sets the metric for a downed link to infinity
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: When a network goes down, the distance-vector routing protocol initiates route poisoning by advertising the network with a metric of 16, or unreachable.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Which of the following is true regarding RIPv2?
    <br/>
    a) It has a lower administrative distance than RIPv1
    <br/>
    b) It converges faster than RIPv1
    <br/>
    c) It has the same timers as RIPv1
    <br/>
    d) It is harder to configure than RIPv1
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: RIPv2 is pretty much just like RIPv1. It has the same administrative distance and timers and is configured just like RIPv1.

    4. Which of the situations might not require multiple routing protocols in a network?
    <br/>
    a) When a new Layer 2-only switch is added to the network
    <br/>
    b) When you are migrating from one routing protocol to another
    <br/>
    c) When you are using routers from multiple vendors
    <br/>
    d) When there are host-based routers from multiple vendors
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Multiple routing protocols are required only when we need to migrate from one routing protocol to another, or when we are using routers from multiple vendors, or when there are host-based routers from multiple vendors. Routing is not a layer-2 function so we don’t require multiple routing protocols when new layer-2 switch is added.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. Which two routing protocols can be redistributed into OSPF by a Cisco router?
    <br/>
    a) IP EIGRP and AppleTalk EIGRP
    <br/>
    b) AppleTalk EIGRP and RIPv2
    <br/>
    c) RIPv2 and IP EIGRP
    <br/>
    d) IPX RIP &amp; AppleTalk EIGRP
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: OSPF stands for Open Shortest Path First. It is a Link state routing protocol. IP EIGRP and RIPv2 can be redistributed into OSPF by a Cisco router.

    6. Which is a reason for avoiding doing route redistribution on two routers between the same two routing domains?
    <br/>
    a) Higher cost of two routers
    <br/>
    b) Routing feedback
    <br/>
    c) Cisco IOS incompatibility
    <br/>
    d) Not possible to use two routers
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Routing feedback is an anomaly in which the routing protocols go back and forth between one route and another. Routing feedback is a reason for avoiding doing route redistribution on two routers between the same two routing domains.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. What does administrative distance rank?
    <br/>
    a) Metrics
    <br/>
    b) Sources of routing information
    <br/>
    c) Router reliability
    <br/>
    d) Best paths
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Sources of routing information is the administrative distance rank. It is used by routers to select the best path when there are different routes to the same destination. It’s used only two different routing protocols are being used.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Which protocol maintains neighbor adjacencies?
    <br/>
    a) RIPv2 and EIGRP
    <br/>
    b) IGRP and EIGRP
    <br/>
    c) RIPv2
    <br/>
    d) EIGRP
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Neighbor adjacency refers to the formal handshake performed by neighboring routers. It is to be done before the router share any routing information. RIP V2 maintains neighbor adjacencies.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. Which routing protocol implements the diffusing update algorithm?
    <br/>
    a) IS-IS
    <br/>
    b) IGRP
    <br/>
    c) EIGRP
    <br/>
    d) OSPF
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The diffusing update algorithm (DUAL) is used to maintain backup routes to a destination for when the primary route fails. EIGRP routing protocol implements the diffusing update algorithm.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Cookies”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Cookies were originally designed for ____________
    <br/>
    a) Client side programming
    <br/>
    b) Server side programming
    <br/>
    c) Both Client side programming and Server side programming
    <br/>
    d) Socket programming
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Cookies were originally designed for server side programming, and at the lowest level, they are implemented as an extension to the HTTP protocol. They were introduced with the intention of providing a better user experience for the websites.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. The Cookie manipulation is done using which property?
    <br/>
    a) cookie
    <br/>
    b) cookies
    <br/>
    c) manipulate
    <br/>
    d) manipulate cookie
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The cookie property sets or returns all name/value pairs of cookies in the current document. There are no methods involved: cookies are queried, set, and deleted by reading and writing the cookie property of the Document object using specially formatted strings.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Which of the following explains Cookies nature?
    <br/>
    a) Non Volatile
    <br/>
    b) Volatile
    <br/>
    c) Intransient
    <br/>
    d) Transient
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Cookies are transient by default; the values they store last for the duration of the web browser session but are lost when the user exits the browser. While the browsing session is active the cookie stores the user values in the user’s storage itself and accesses them.

    4. Which attribute is used to extend the lifetime of a cookie?
    <br/>
    a) Higher-age
    <br/>
    b) Increase-age
    <br/>
    c) Max-age
    <br/>
    d) Lifetime
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: If you want a cookie to last beyond a single browsing session, you must tell the browser how long (in seconds) you would like it to retain the cookie by specifying a max-age attribute. A number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will kill the cookie immediately.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. Which of the following defines the Cookie visibility?
    <br/>
    a) Document Path
    <br/>
    b) LocalStorage
    <br/>
    c) SessionStorage
    <br/>
    d) All of the mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: sessionStorage, localStorage and Document path all are used to store data on the client-side. Each one has its own storage and expiration limit. Cookie visibility is scoped by the document origin as Local Storage and Session Storage are, and also by document path.
   </div>
   <div style="margin:30px 0px;">

    6. Which of the following can be used to configure the scope of the Cookie visibility?
    <br/>
    a) Path
    <br/>
    b) Domain
    <br/>
    c) Both Path  and Domain
    <br/>
    d) Server
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The Cookie visibility scope is configurable through cookie attributes path and domain. Domain attribute in the cookie is used to specify the domain for which the cookie is sent. Path includes the Path attribute in the cookie to specify the path for which this cookie is sent.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. How can you set a Cookie visibility scope to local Storage?
    <br/>
    a) /
    <br/>
    b) %
    <br/>
    c) *
    <br/>
    d) #
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Setting the path of a cookie to “/” gives scoping like that of localStorage and also specifies that the browser must transmit the cookie name and value to the server whenever it requests any web page on the site.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Which of the following is a Boolean cookie attribute?
    <br/>
    a) Bool
    <br/>
    b) Secure
    <br/>
    c) Lookup
    <br/>
    d) Domain
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The final cookie attribute is a boolean attribute named secure that specifies how cookie values are transmitted over the network. By default, cookies are insecure, which means that they are transmitted over a normal, insecure HTTP connection. If a cookie is marked secure, however, it is transmitted only when the browser and server are connected via HTTPS or another secure protocol.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. Which of the following function is used as a consequence of not including semicolons, Commas or whitespace in the Cookie value?
    <br/>
    a) EncodeURIComponent()
    <br/>
    b) EncodeURI()
    <br/>
    c) EncodeComponent()
    <br/>
    d) Encode()
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Cookie values cannot include semicolons, commas, or whitespace. For this reason, you may want to use the core JavaScript global function encodeURIComponent() to encode the value before storing it in the cookie.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. What is the constraint on the data per cookie?
    <br/>
    a) 2 KB
    <br/>
    b) 1 KB
    <br/>
    c) 4 KB
    <br/>
    d) 3 KB
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Each cookie can hold up to only 4 KB. In practice, browsers allow many more than 300 cookies total, but the 4 KB size limit may still be enforced by some. Storage of a session has to be a minimum of 5MB.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Web Caching”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. What does REST stand for?
    <br/>
    a) Represent State Transfer
    <br/>
    b) Representational State Transfer
    <br/>
    c) Representing State Transfer
    <br/>
    d) Representation State Transfer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is a software architecture style in which the server sends a representation of the state of the resource that it requests. It provides interoperability between the systems.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Which of the following protocol is used by Restful web services as a medium of communication between client and server?
    <br/>
    a) HTTP
    <br/>
    b) FTP
    <br/>
    c) Gopher
    <br/>
    d) TELNET
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Restful web services make use of HTTP protocol as a medium of communication between client and server. The REST architecture was known as the HTTP object model back in the year 1994.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Which of the following is not a good practice to create a standard URI for a web service?
    <br/>
    a) Maintain Backward Compatibility
    <br/>
    b) Use HTTP Verb
    <br/>
    c) Using spaces for long resource names
    <br/>
    d) Use lowercase letters
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: We must use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) instead of spaces to represent long resource names. It may lead to the resource to be less recognizable for the system if we use spaces instead.

    <br/>
    a) OPTIONS
    <br/>
    b) DELETE
    <br/>
    c) POST
    <br/>
    d) HEAD
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: DELETE operation should be idempotent, means their result will always same no matter how many times these operations are invoked. Also, the PUT operation is supposed to be idempotent.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. Which of the following directive of Cache Control Header of HTTP response indicates that resource is cachable by only client and server?
    <br/>
    a) Public
    <br/>
    b) Private
    <br/>
    c) Nocache/nostore
    <br/>
    d) Maxage
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Private directive indicates that resource is cachable by only client and server; no intermediary can cache the resource. But if we use the public directive, it indicates that the resource may be cachable by any intermediary component.

    d) 304
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: HTTP Status Code 201 means CREATED, when a resource is successful created using POST or PUT request. The code 200 means success i.e. OK, code 204 means NO CONTENT, and the code 304 means NOT MODIFIED.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. Which of the following annotation of JAX RS API is used to annotate a method used to create resource?
    <br/>
    a) @Path
    <br/>
    b) @GET
    <br/>
    c) @PUT
    <br/>
    d) @POST
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: @PUT is the HTTP request that is used to create resource and also define a complete resource path. @POST may also be used to create a resource but it won’t define a resource path i.e. an accessing medium.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Which of the following annotation of JAX RS API binds the parameter passed to method to a HTTP matrix parameter in path?
    <br/>
    a) @PathParam
    <br/>
    b) @QueryParam
    <br/>
    c) @MatrixParam
    <br/>
    d) @HeaderParam
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: @MatrixParam is the annotation that binds the parameter passed to method to a HTTP matrix parameter in path, while @QueryParam binds to a query parameter, @PathParam binds to a value and @HeaderParam binds to the HTTP header in the path.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. In REST architecture, a REST Server simply provides access to resources and REST client accesses and presents the resources.
    <br/>
    a) False
    <br/>
    b) True
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: In REST architecture, a REST Server simply provides access to resources and REST client accesses and presents the resources. It is popularly used because it makes efficient use of the bandwidth and can be cached for better performance and scalability.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. POST operation should be idempotent.
    <br/>
    a) True
    <br/>
    b) False
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: POST operation can cause different result so they are not idempotent. The DELETE and PUT operations are idempotent as they invoke the same result every time they are called.

    This set of Computer Networks online test focuses on “Packet Forwarding and Routing”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. The term that is used to place packet in its route to its destination is called __________
    <br/>
    a) Delayed
    <br/>
    b) Urgent
    <br/>
    c) Forwarding
    <br/>
    d) Delivering
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Forwarding is done by the nodes in the path from source to destination, that are not the intended destination for the packet in order to pass the packet to the next node in the path. The destination machine does not forward the packet to any other node.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. A second technique to reduce routing table and simplify searching process is called _________
    <br/>
    a) Network-Specific Method
    <br/>
    b) Network-Specific Motion
    <br/>
    c) Network-Specific Maintaining
    <br/>
    d) Network-Specific Membership
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In the network specific forwarding method, there is only one record, the destination of the packet, in the routing table and not the other hosts of the network. The other two forwarding methods are the default method and the next-hop method.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Next-Hop Method is used to reduce contents of a _________
    <br/>
    a) Revolving table
    <br/>
    b) Rotating Table
    <br/>
    c) Routing Table
    <br/>
    d) Re-allocate table
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: In the next-hop forwarding method, the routing table of each router in the path contains the address of only the next hop in the path of packet. This method is suitable for short distances only.

    4. Several techniques can make size of routing table manageable and also handle issues such as __________
    <br/>
    a) Maturity
    <br/>
    b) Error reporting
    <br/>
    c) Tunneling
    <br/>
    d) Security
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The size of the routing table in the technique must be manageable for the network nodes i.e. it must not be too big. Security of the forwarding packet is the highest priority for a technique and must be high enough so that only authorized senders and receivers can access the packet’s content.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. Host-specific routing is used for purposes such as checking route or providing _____
    <br/>
    a) Network Measures
    <br/>
    b) Security Measures
    <br/>
    c) Routing Measures
    <br/>
    d) Delivery Measures
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: In host-specific routing, the route of the packet is defined based on the exact match of the packet’s IP with the routing table entry of the host. It provides the best security for the packet as the packet is forwarded only to routers in the pre-defined path.

    6. In Unicast routing, if instability is between three nodes, stability cannot be ________
    <br/>
    a) Stable
    <br/>
    b) Reversed
    <br/>
    c) Guaranteed
    <br/>
    d) Forward
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: In Unicast routing, there is only sender and one receiver. So, if there is instability between three nodes, in which one is sender, one is receiver and one is the router in the path, there is no other path available for the packet and the stability of the network is not guaranteed.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. In Unicast Routing, Dijkstra algorithm creates a shortest path tree from a ________
    <br/>
    a) Graph
    <br/>
    b) Tree
    <br/>
    c) Network
    <br/>
    d) Link
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The Djikstra’s shortest path algorithm is the fastest among the algorithms for finding the shortest path in a graph. But it is a greedy method based algorithm so it does not guarantee the shortest path every time.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. In Multicast Routing Protocol, flooding is used to broadcast packets but it creates ________
    <br/>
    a) Gaps
    <br/>
    b) Loops
    <br/>
    c) Holes
    <br/>
    d) Links
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: In multicast routing, there is one sender and many receivers. So flooding is the most basic method to forward packets to many receivers. The one issue with flooding is that it creates routing loops. One loop prevention method is that the routers will not send the packet to a node where the packet has been received before.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. RPF stands for __________
    <br/>
    a) Reverse Path Forwarding
    <br/>
    b) Reverse Path Failure
    <br/>
    c) Reverse Packet Forwarding
    <br/>
    d) Reverse Protocol Failure
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Reverse Path Forwarding is a loop-free forwarding method for multi-cast routing in modern systems. The method focuses on forwarding the packet away from the source IP in each iteration to make sure there is no loops.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. LSP stands for __________
    <br/>
    a) Link Stable Packet
    <br/>
    b) Link State Packet
    <br/>
    c) Link State Protocol
    <br/>
    d) Link State Path
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: A Link State Packet is a packet created by a router that lists its neighboring nodes and routers in link state routing protocol. It is shared with other routers to find the shortest path from a source to the destination.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Security In The Internet”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. IPSec is designed to provide security at the _________
    <br/>
    a) transport layer
    <br/>
    b) network layer
    <br/>
    c) application layer
    <br/>
    d) session layer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: IPSec is a set of protocols used to provide authentication, data integrity and confidentiality between two machines in an IP network. In the TCP/IP model, it provides security at the IP layer i.e. the network layer.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    2. In tunnel mode, IPSec protects the ______
    <br/>
    a) Entire IP packet
    <br/>
    b) IP header
    <br/>
    c) IP payload
    <br/>
    d) IP trailer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In the tunnel mode, IPSec adds control bits into the packets to encrypt the entire packet between the IPSec endpoints. Using encryption, it provides secure communication between the two endpoints.
    <br/>
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Network layer firewall works as a ________
    <br/>
    a) frame filter
    <br/>
    b) packet filter
    <br/>
    c) signal filter
    <br/>
    d) content filter
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: As you know, firewalls are available as hardware appliances, as software-only, or a combination of the two. In every case, the purpose of a firewall is to isolate your trusted internal network (or your personal PC) from the dangers of unknown resources on the Internet and other network connections that may be harmful. The firewall prevents unauthorized access to your internal, trusted network from outside threats.

    d) network firewall and data firewall
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Most network layer firewalls can operate as stateful or stateless firewalls, creating two subcategories of the standard network layer firewall. Stateful firewalls have the advantage of being able to track packets over a period of time for greater analysis and accuracy — but they require more memory and operate more slowly. Stateless firewalls do not analyze past traffic and can be useful for systems where speed is more important than security, or for systems that have very specific and limited needs. For example, a computer that only needs to connect to a particular backup server does not need the extra security of a stateful firewall.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “OSPF”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is also called as _____________
    <br/>
    a) Link state protocol
    <br/>
    b) Error-correction protocol
    <br/>
    c) Routing information protocol
    <br/>
    d) Border gateway protocol
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: In OSPF, the link state of each path is checked, and then the shortest path is chosen among only the open state links. Each OSPF router monitors the cost of the link to each of its neighbors and then floods the link state information to other routers in the network.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. The computation of the shortest path in OSPF is usually done by ____________
    <br/>
    a) Bellman-ford algorithm
    <br/>
    b) Routing information protocol
    <br/>
    c) Dijkstra’s algorithm
    <br/>
    d) Distance vector routing
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Shortest path in OSPF is usually computed by Dijkstra’s algorithm. It was proposed by Edsger W. Dijkstra in the year 1956. It is a greedy method algorithm and hence may not guarantee the shortest path every time, but is really fast.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Which of the following is false with respect to the features of OSPF?
    <br/>
    a) Support for fixed-length subnetting by including the subnet mask in the routing message
    <br/>
    b) More flexible link cost than can range from 1 to 65535
    <br/>
    c) Use of designated router
    <br/>
    d) Distribution of traffic over multiple paths that have equal cost to the destination
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: OSPF provides support for variable-length sunbathing by including the subnet mask in the routing message. For fixed length subnets, there is no requirement for including the subnet mask in the routing message as there is just one subnet mask for all the subnets.

    4. In OSPF, which protocol is used to discover neighbour routers automatically?
    <br/>
    a) Link state protocol
    <br/>
    b) Error-correction protocol
    <br/>
    c) Routing information protocol
    <br/>
    d) Hello protocol
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Hello protocol is used to discover neighboring routers automatically. It makes sure that the communication between neighbors is bidirectional. It’s similar to the real world moral construct of saying “Hello” to initialize the communication.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. Which of the following is not a type of OSPF packet?
    <br/>
    a) Hello
    <br/>
    b) Link-state request
    <br/>
    c) Link-state response
    <br/>
    d) Link-state ACK
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: The five types of OSPF packets are: Hello, Database description, Link-state request, Link-state update, and Link-state ACK. There is no Link-state response packet; the neighbor router sends a Link-state update packet as a response to the Link-state request packet if there is an update in the routing table.

    </div>
   </div>
   <p>
    6. What is the correct order of the operations of OSPF?
    <br/>
    i – Hello packets
    <br/>
    ii – Propagation of link-state information and building of routing tables
    <br/>
    iii – Establishing adjacencies and synchronization of database
    <br/>
    a) i-ii-iii
    <br/>
    b) i-iii-ii
    <br/>
    c) iii-ii-i
    <br/>
    d) ii-i-iii
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: OSPF first implements a hello protocol. Then it later on tries to establish synchronisation with database. Later on building of routing tables is done.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. In OSPF header, which field is used to detect errors in the packet?
    <br/>
    a) Type
    <br/>
    b) Area ID
    <br/>
    c) Authentication type
    <br/>
    d) Checksum
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Checksum field is used to detect errors. It makes sure that the data portions that are being sent are all in integrity. It can detect duplicated bits. Once an error is detected, the sender has to re-transmit the data as it won’t receive an acknowledgement.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. In OSPF database descriptor packet, if there are more database descriptor packets in the flow, ‘M’ field is set to ____________
    <br/>
    a) 1
    <br/>
    b) 0
    <br/>
    c) more
    <br/>
    d) -1
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The “M” bit is the more bit, which indicates that there are more packets to be received in the descriptor packet flow whenever it is set to 1. There is also an “I” bit which indicates if the packet is first in the flow.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. In OSPF database descriptor packet, which field is used to indicate that the router is master?
    <br/>
    a) M
    <br/>
    b) MS
    <br/>
    c) I
    <br/>
    d) Options
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The MS bit is used to indicate if the origin of the packet is a master or a slave. If it is set to 1, the source of the packet is a master, and if it is set to 0, the source of the packet is a slave.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. In OSPF database descriptor packet, which field is used to detect a missing packet?
    <br/>
    a) LSA header
    <br/>
    b) MS
    <br/>
    c) Database descriptor sequence number
    <br/>
    d) Options
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Sequence number field is used to detect a missing packet. The packets are to be received in order of the sequence number, so if the receiver detects that there is a sequence number skipped or missing in the order, it stops processing the further received packets and informs the sender to retransmit the packets in sequence.

    This set of Computer Networks online quiz focuses on “OSPF Configuration”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. An OSPF router receives an LSA, the router checks its sequence number, and this number matches the sequence number of the LSA that the receiving router already has. What does the receiving router do with the LSA?
    <br/>
    a) Ignores the LSA
    <br/>
    b) Adds it to the database
    <br/>
    c) Sends newer LSU update to source router
    <br/>
    d) Floods the LSA to the other routers
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: When the OSPF router receives an LSA, the router checks its sequence number. If this number matches the sequence number of the LSA that the receiving router already has, the router ignores the LSA.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. An OSPF router receives an LSA. The router checks its sequence number and finds that this number is higher than the sequence number it already has. Which two tasks does the router perform with the LSA?
    <br/>
    a) Ignores the LSA
    <br/>
    b) Adds it to the database
    <br/>
    c) Sends newer LSU update to source router
    <br/>
    d) Floods the LSA to the other routers
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: An OSPF router receives an LSA. If the router checks its sequence number and finds that the number is higher than the sequence number of the LSA that it already has, the router adds it to the database, and then floods the LSA to the other routers.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. An OSPF router receives an LSA. The router checks its sequence number and finds that this number is lower than the sequence number it already has. What does the router do with the LSA?
    <br/>
    a) ignores the LSA
    <br/>
    b) adds it to the database
    <br/>
    c) sends newer LSU update to source router
    <br/>
    d) floods the LSA to the other routers
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: An OSPF router receives an LSA. If the router checks its sequence number and finds that this number is lower than the sequence number that it already has, the router sends newer LSU update to source router. The router then adds it to the database and floods it to the other routers.

    4. Each LSA has its own age timer. By default, how long does an LSA wait before requiring an update?
    <br/>
    a) 30 seconds
    <br/>
    b) 1 minute
    <br/>
    c) 30 minutes
    <br/>
    d) 1 hour
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Each LSA has its own age timer. By default, an LSA waits for 30 minutes before requiring an update. The router then has to send a LSR (Link State Request) to its neighbors to get an update.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. Distance vector protocols use the concept of split horizon, but link-state routing protocols, such as OSPF, do not.
    <br/>
    a) True
    <br/>
    b) False
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: In Distance vector routing protocols, there is a problem called count-to-infinity which occurs regularly. So, to make sure that it does not occur, the split horizon algorithm is used. There is no requirement for it in OSPF.

    6. The outcome of Dijkstra’s calculation is used to populate the __________
    <br/>
    a) Topology table
    <br/>
    b) Routing table
    <br/>
    c) Neighbor table
    <br/>
    d) Adjacency table
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The outcome of Djikstra’s calculation is the main source of entries in the routing table as it is the algorithm that is used to find the shortest path in OSPF. The calculations are done after receiving every new LSU.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. What is the IP protocol number for OSPF packets?
    <br/>
    a) 89
    <br/>
    b) 86
    <br/>
    c) 20
    <br/>
    d) 76
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: 89 is the IP protocol number for OSPF packets. 86 is the protocol number for DGP, 76 is the protocol number for Backroom-SATNET-Monitoring and 20 is the protocol number for Host Monitoring Protocol.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. Which packet is NOT an OSPF packet type?
    <br/>
    a) LSU
    <br/>
    b) LSR
    <br/>
    c) DBD
    <br/>
    d) Query
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: LSU is the Link State Update packet, LSR is the Link State Request packet and DBD is the Database Descriptor packet in OSPF. Query packet is NOT an OSPF packet type.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. Which multicast address does the OSPF Hello protocol use?
    <br/>
    a) 224.0.0.5
    <br/>
    b) 224.0.0.6
    <br/>
    c) 224.0.0.7
    <br/>
    d) 224.0.0.8
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Hello protocol is used to discover neighboring routers automatically. It makes sure that the communication between neighbors is bidirectional. The multicast address that the OSPF Hello protocol uses is 224.0.0.5.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. The Hello protocol sends periodic updates to ensure that a neighbor relationship is maintained between adjacent routers.
    <br/>
    a) True
    <br/>
    b) False
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The Hello protocol sends periodic updates to ensure that a neighbor relationship is maintained between adjacent routers. It’s similar to the real world moral construct of saying “Hello” to initialize the communication.
   </div>
   <p>
    11. DBD packets are involved during which two states?
    <br/>
    a) Exstart and exchange
    <br/>
    b) Loading and Two-way
    <br/>
    c) Init and Full
    <br/>
    d) Down and Loading
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: DBD stands for Database Descriptor. DBD packets are involved during the two states Exstart and Exchange. In exstart, the master and the slaves are decided and in the exchange state, the DBD is exchanged among the neighbors.
   </div>
   <p>
    12. At which interval does OSPF refresh LSAs?
    <br/>
    a) 10 seconds
    <br/>
    b) 30 seconds
    <br/>
    c) 30 minutes
    <br/>
    d) 1 hour
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Each LSA has its own age timer. By default, an LSA waits for 30 minutes before requiring an update. So to make sure that each router first has an up-to-date LSA, OSPF refreshes LSAs after every 1 hour.
   </div>
   <p>
    13. Which field is NOT a field within an OSPF packet header?
    <br/>
    a) Packet length
    <br/>
    b) Router ID
    <br/>
    c) Authentication type
    <br/>
    d) Maxage time
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The packet length field gives the length of the packet in bits. The Authentication type field gives the type of authentication used. The router ID field gives the ID of the source router of the packet. In an OSPF packet header, there is no field called Maxage time.
   </div>
   <p>
    14. Which two commands are required for basic OSPF configuration?
    <br/>
    a) “[Network mask] area [area-id]” and “Router ospf [process-id]”
    <br/>
    b) “[Wildcard-mask] area [area-id]” and “[Network mask] area [area-id]”
    <br/>
    c) Only “Router ospf [process-id]”
    <br/>
    d) “[Wildcard-mask] area [area-id]” and “Router ospf [process-id]”
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The “Router ospf [process-id]” command enables OSPF routing protocol in the router and the “[Wildcard-mask] area [area-id]” command is used to select the interfaces that we want to include in the OSPF process. That is enough for the basic configuration of OSPF in a router.
   </div>
   <p>
    15. Which OSPF show command describes a list of OSPF adjacencies?
    <br/>
    a) Show ip ospf interface
    <br/>
    b) Show ip ospf
    <br/>
    c) Show ip route
    <br/>
    d) Show ip ospf neighbor
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The “Show ip ospf neighbor” command is the OSPF show command that can describe a list of OSPF adjacencies i.e. the list of adjacent nodes or neighbors. The router will only communicate with its neighbors directly.

    This set of Computer Networks Questions and Answers for Aptitude test focuses on “Datagram Networks”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Datagram switching is done at which layer of OSI model?
    <br/>
    a) Network layer
    <br/>
    b) Physical layer
    <br/>
    c) Application layer
    <br/>
    d) Transport layer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Datagram switching is normally done at network layer. In datagram switching, the datagram stream need not be in order as each datagram can take different routes to the destination.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Packets in datagram switching are referred to as ________
    <br/>
    a) Switches
    <br/>
    b) Segments
    <br/>
    c) Datagrams
    <br/>
    d) Data-packets
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: As the name suggests, in datagram switching packets are called as datagram. Each datagram/packet is treated as an individual entity and routed independently through the network.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. Datagram networks mainly refers to _________
    <br/>
    a) Connection oriented networks
    <br/>
    b) Connection less networks
    <br/>
    c) Telephone networks
    <br/>
    d) Internetwork
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The switch does not keep the information about the connection state, hence it is connection less. There is no need for establishing a handshake to begin the transmission in such networks.

    <br/>
    c) Datagram table
    <br/>
    d) Routing table
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Routing table is used to route the packets to their destinations. The packet/datagram header contains the destination header for the whole journey to source to the destination through the routers.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. The main contents of the routing table in datagram networks are ___________
    <br/>
    a) Source and Destination address
    <br/>
    b) Destination address and Output port
    <br/>
    c) Source address and Output port
    <br/>
    d) Input port and Output port
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Routing table contains destination address and output port to route the packets to their destinations. The port address specifies the particular application that the packet has to be forwarded to after it has reached the destination.

    6. Which of the following remains same in the header of the packet in a datagram network during the entire journey of the packet?
    <br/>
    a) Destination address
    <br/>
    b) Source address
    <br/>
    c) Checksum
    <br/>
    d) Padding
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Destination address remains same in the header during the entire journey of the packet. There is no pre-decided route for the packets so each datagram/packet is treated as an individual entity and routed independently through the network.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. Which of the following is true with respect to the delay in datagram networks?
    <br/>
    a) Delay is greater than in a virtual circuit network
    <br/>
    b) Each packet may experience a wait at a switch
    <br/>
    c) Delay is not uniform for the packets of a message
    <br/>
    d) All of the mentioned
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The delay of each packet in a datagram network is different as each packet might take a different route to the destination. The delay includes the propagation delay and the processing delay that is induced at each stop/switch that the packet encounters in its journey.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. During datagram switching, the packets are placed in __________ to wait until the given transmission line becomes available.
    <br/>
    a) Stack
    <br/>
    b) Queue
    <br/>
    c) Hash
    <br/>
    d) Routing table
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: When there are too many packets to be transmitted and the transmission line gets blocked while transmitting some packets, the remaining packets are stored in queue during delay and are served as first in first out. The delay is called as queuing delay.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. The probability of the error in a transmitted block _________ with the length of the block
    <br/>
    a) Remains same
    <br/>
    b) Decreases
    <br/>
    c) Increases
    <br/>
    d) Is not proportional
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Probability of the error in a transmitted block increases with the length of the block. Hence, the blocks should be as short as possible for ideal transmission with low possibility of an error.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. Which of the following is false with respect to the datagram networks?
    <br/>
    a) Number of flows of packets are not limited
    <br/>
    b) Packets may not be in order at the destination
    <br/>
    c) Path is not reserved
    <br/>
    d) Delay is the same for all packets in a flow
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The delay of each packet in a datagram network is different as each packet might take a different route to the destination. This happens because there is no pre-decided route for the packets.

    This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions &amp; Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Firewalls”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Network layer firewall works as a __________
    <br/>
    a) Frame filter
    <br/>
    b) Packet filter
    <br/>
    c) Content filter
    <br/>
    d) Virus filter
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: As you know, firewalls are available as hardware appliances, as software-only, or a combination of the two. In every case, the purpose of a firewall is to isolate your trusted internal network (or your personal PC) from the dangers of unknown resources on the Internet and other network connections that may be harmful. The firewall prevents unauthorized access to your internal, trusted network from outside threats.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. Network layer firewall has two sub-categories as _________
    <br/>
    a) State full firewall and stateless firewall
    <br/>
    b) Bit oriented firewall and byte oriented firewall
    <br/>
    c) Frame firewall and packet firewall
    <br/>
    d) Network layer firewall and session layer firewall
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: Most network layer firewalls can operate as stateful or stateless firewalls, creating two subcategories of the standard network layer firewall. Stateful firewalls have the advantage of being able to track packets over a period of time for greater analysis and accuracy — but they require more memory and operate more slowly. Stateless firewalls do not analyze past traffic and can be useful for systems where speed is more important than security, or for systems that have very specific and limited needs. For example, a computer that only needs to connect to a particular backup server does not need the extra security of a stateful firewall.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. A firewall is installed at the point where the secure internal network and untrusted external network meet which is also known as __________
    <br/>
    a) Chock point
    <br/>
    b) Meeting point
    <br/>
    c) Firewall point
    <br/>
    d) Secure point
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: A firewall can be a PC, a router, a midrange, a mainframe, a UNIX workstation, or a combination of these that determines which information or services can be accessed from the outside and who is permitted to use the information and services from outside. Generally, a firewall is installed at the point where the secure internal network and untrusted external network meet, which is also known as a chokepoint.

    4. Which of the following is / are the types of firewall?
    <br/>
    a) Packet Filtering Firewall
    <br/>
    b) Dual Homed Gateway Firewall
    <br/>
    c) Screen Host Firewall
    <br/>
    d) Dual Host Firewall
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: A firewall can be a PC, a midrange, a mainframe, a UNIX workstation, a router, or combination of these. Depending on the requirements, a firewall can consist of one or more of the following functional components: Packet-filtering router
   </div>

    5. A proxy firewall filters at _________
    <br/>
    a) Physical layer
    <br/>
    b) Data link layer
    <br/>
    c) Network layer
    <br/>
    d) Application layer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: The application firewall is typically built to control all network traffic on any layer up to the application layer. It is able to control applications or services specifically, unlike a stateful network firewall, which is – without additional software – unable to control network traffic regarding a specific application. There are two primary categories of application firewalls, network-based application firewalls and host-based application firewalls.

    6. A packet filter firewall filters at __________
    <br/>
    a) Physical layer
    <br/>
    b) Data link layer
    <br/>
    c) Network layer or Transport layer
    <br/>
    d) Application layer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.[1] A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted, secure internal network and another outside network, such as the Internet, that is assumed not to be secure or trusted.[2] Firewalls are often categorized as either network firewalls or host-based firewalls.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. What is one advantage of setting up a DMZ with two firewalls?
    <br/>
    a) You can control where traffic goes in three networks
    <br/>
    b) You can do stateful packet filtering
    <br/>
    c) You can do load balancing
    <br/>
    d) Improved network performance
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: DMZ stands for De-Militarized Zone. In a topology with a single firewall serving both internal and external users (LAN and WAN), it acts as a shared resource for these two zones. So load balancing can be done by adding another firewall.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. What tells a firewall how to reassemble a data stream that has been divided into packets?
    <br/>
    a) The source routing feature
    <br/>
    b) The number in the header’s identification field
    <br/>
    c) The destination IP address
    <br/>
    d) The header checksum field in the packet header
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The source routing feature provides a path address for the packet to help the firewall to reassemble the data stream that was divided into packets. After reassembling, the firewall can then filter the stream.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. A stateful firewall maintains a ___________ which is a list of active connections.
    <br/>
    a) Routing table
    <br/>
    b) Bridging table
    <br/>
    c) State table
    <br/>
    d) Connection table
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: The routing table basically gives the state of each connection i.e. whether the connection is active or not. A routing table ensures the best performance for the stateful firewall.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. A firewall needs to be __________ so that it can grow proportionally with the network that it protects.
    <br/>
    a) Robust
    <br/>
    b) Expansive
    <br/>
    c) Fast
    <br/>
    d) Scalable
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: The firewall has to be expansive because a network is expected to grow with time and if the firewall is unable to grow with it, the firewall won’t be able to handle the growing network traffic flow and will hence fail.

    This set of Computer Networks Questions and Answers for Entrance exams focuses on “Intrusion Detection Systems”.
   </p>
   <p>
    1. Which of the following is an advantage of anomaly detection?
    <br/>
    a) Rules are easy to define
    <br/>
    b) Custom protocols can be easily analyzed
    <br/>
    c) The engine can scale as the rule set grows
    <br/>
    d) Malicious activity that falls within normal usage patterns is detected
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: Once a protocol has been built and a behavior defined, the engine can scale more quickly and easily than the signature-based model because a new signature does not have to be created for every attack and potential variant.
   </div>
   <p>
    2. A false positive can be defined as ________
    <br/>
    a) An alert that indicates nefarious activity on a system that, upon further inspection, turns out to represent legitimate network traffic or behavior
    <br/>
    b) An alert that indicates nefarious activity on a system that is not running on the network
    <br/>
    c) The lack of an alert for nefarious activity
    <br/>
    d) Both An alert that indicates nefarious activity on a system that, upon further inspection, turns out to represent legitimate network traffic or behavior and An alert that indicates nefarious activity on a system that is not running on the network
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: A false positive is any alert that indicates nefarious activity on a system that, upon further inspection, turns out to represent legitimate network traffic or behavior.
   </div>
   <p>
    3. One of the most obvious places to put an IDS sensor is near the firewall. Where exactly in relation to the firewall is the most productive placement?
    <br/>
    a) Inside the firewall
    <br/>
    b) Outside the firewall
    <br/>
    c) Both inside and outside the firewall
    <br/>
    d) Neither inside the firewall nor outside the firewall.
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: There are legitimate political, budgetary and research reasons to want to see all the “attacks” against your connection, but given the care and feeding any IDS requires, do yourself a favor and keep your NIDS sensors on the inside of the firewall.

    4. What is the purpose of a shadow honeypot?
    <br/>
    a) To flag attacks against known vulnerabilities
    <br/>
    b) To help reduce false positives in a signature-based IDS
    <br/>
    c) To randomly check suspicious traffic identified by an anomaly detection system
    <br/>
    d) To enhance the accuracy of a traditional honeypot
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: c
    <br/>
    Explanation: “Shadow honeypots,” as researchers call them, share all the same characteristics of protected applications running on both the server and client side of a network and operate in conjunction with an ADS.
   </div>
   <p>
    5. At which two traffic layers do most commercial IDSes generate signatures?
    <br/>
    a) Application layer and Network layer
    <br/>
    b) Network layer and Session Layer
    <br/>
    c) Transport layer and Application layer
    <br/>
    d) Transport layer and Network layer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Most commercial IDSes generate signatures at the network and transport layers. These signatures are used to ensure that no malicious operation is contained in the traffic. Nemean generates signature at application and session layer.

    6. IDS follows a two-step process consisting of a passive component and an active component. Which of the following is part of the active component?
    <br/>
    a) Inspection of password files to detect inadvisable passwords
    <br/>
    b) Mechanisms put in place to reenact known methods of attack and record system responses
    <br/>
    c) Inspection of system to detect policy violations
    <br/>
    d) Inspection of configuration files to detect inadvisable settings
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: Secondary components of mechanism are set in place to reenact known methods of attack and to record system responses. In passive components, the system I designed just to record the system’s responses in case of an intrusion.
   </div>
   <p>
    7. When discussing IDS/IPS, what is a signature?
    <br/>
    a) An electronic signature used to authenticate the identity of a user on the network
    <br/>
    b) Attack-definition file
    <br/>
    c) It refers to “normal,” baseline network behavior
    <br/>
    d) It is used to authorize the users on a network
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: b
    <br/>
    Explanation: IDSes work in a manner similar to modern antivirus technology. They are constantly updated with attack-definition files (signatures) that describe each type of known malicious activity. Nemean is a popular signature generation method for conventional computer networks.
   </div>
   <p>
    8. “Semantics-aware” signatures automatically generated by Nemean are based on traffic at which two layers?
    <br/>
    a) Application layer and Transport layer
    <br/>
    b) Network layer and Application layer
    <br/>
    c) Session layer and Transport layer
    <br/>
    d) Application layer and Session layer
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: Nemean automatically generates “semantics-aware” signatures based on traffic at the session and application layers. These signatures are used to ensure that no malicious operation is contained in the traffic.
   </div>
   <p>
    9. Which of the following is used to provide a baseline measure for comparison of IDSes?
    <br/>
    a) Crossover error rate
    <br/>
    b) False negative rate
    <br/>
    c) False positive rate
    <br/>
    d) Bit error rate
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: a
    <br/>
    Explanation: As the sensitivity of systems may cause the false positive/negative rates to vary, it’s critical to have some common measure that may be applied across the board.
   </div>
   <p>
    10. Which of the following is true of signature-based IDSes?
    <br/>
    a) They alert administrators to deviations from “normal” traffic behavior
    <br/>
    b) They identify previously unknown attacks
    <br/>
    c) The technology is mature and reliable enough to use on production networks
    <br/>
    d) They scan network traffic or packets to identify matches with attack-definition files
    <br/>
   </p>
   <div>
    Answer: d
    <br/>
    Explanation: They are constantly updated with attack-definition files (signatures) that describe each type of known malicious activity. They then scan network traffic for packets that match the signatures, and then raise alerts to security administrators.
